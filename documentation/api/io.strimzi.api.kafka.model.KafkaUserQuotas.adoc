Kafka allows a user to set `quotas` to control the use of resources by clients.

.`quotas`

Quotas split into two categories:

* _Network usage_ quotas, which are defined as the byte rate threshold for each group of clients sharing a quota
* _CPU utilization_ quotas, which are defined as the percentage of time a client can utilize on request handler I/O threads and network threads of each broker within a quota window

Using quotas for Kafka clients might be useful in a number of situations.
Consider a wrongly configured Kafka producer which is sending requests at too high a rate.
Such misconfiguration can cause a denial of service to other clients, so the problematic client ought to be blocked.
By using a network limiting quota, it is possible to prevent this situation from significantly impacting other clients.

Strimzi supports user-level quotas, but not client-level quotas.
