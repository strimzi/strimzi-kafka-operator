A `PodDisruptionBudget` is a Kubernetes resource that helps maintain high availability during planned maintenance or upgrades.
It defines the minimum number of pods that must remain available at all times.

Strimzi creates one `PodDisruptionBudget` per component:

* Kafka cluster
* Kafka Connect
* MirrorMaker 2
* Kafka Bridge

Each budget applies across all pods deployed for that component.

A single `PodDisruptionBudget` applies to all associated node pool pods managed by the `Kafka` resource.
This is true regardless of how many `StrimziPodSet` resources are created for that component.
Disruption limits are applied at the component level, not per node pool.

By default, only one pod can be unavailable at a time.
You can modify this limit using the `maxUnavailable` property.

`StrimziPodSet` custom resources are managed by a controller that does not use `maxUnavailable` directly.
Instead, the value is automatically converted to `minAvailable`, which serves the same purpose.

For example:

* If there are three broker pods and the `maxUnavailable` property is set to `1` in the `Kafka` resource, the `minAvailable` setting is `2`, allowing one pod to be unavailable.
* If there are three broker pods and the `maxUnavailable` property is set to `0` (zero), the `minAvailable` setting is `3`, requiring all three broker pods to be available and allowing zero pods to be unavailable.

The above examples also applies for the `EntityOperator` and `KafkaExporter` deployment.

.Custom disruption budget behavior

To define custom disruption budget behavior, disable automatic `PodDisruptionBudget` generation.
Set the `STRIMZI_POD_DISRUPTION_BUDGET_GENERATION` environment variable to `false` in the Cluster Operator.

You can then create your own `PodDisruptionBudget` resources.
For example, apply separate budgets to specific node pools using label selectors with `StrimziPodSet` resources.
