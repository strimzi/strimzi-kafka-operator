Configures automatic restarts for connectors and tasks that are in a `FAILED` state.

When enabled, a back-off algorithm applies the automatic restart to each failed connector and its tasks.
An incremental back-off interval is calculated using the formula `n * n + n` where `n` represents the number of previous restarts.
This interval is capped at a default maximum backoff time of 60 minutes. You can configure it using the `maxBackoffMinutes` property.
Consequently, a restart occurs immediately, followed by restarts after 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56 minutes, up to `maxBackoffMinutes`, and then at `maxBackoffMinutes` intervals.
The restart counter is automatically reset once the connector has been running continuously for longer than the next backoff interval.
For example, if the connector has restarted 4 times, it must run without errors for 20 minutes before the restart count resets to 0.
By default, Strimzi initiates restarts of the connector and its tasks indefinitely.
However, you can use the `maxRestarts` property to set a maximum on the number of restarts.
If `maxRestarts` is configured and the connector still fails even after the final restart attempt, you must then restart the connector manually.

For Kafka Connect connectors, use the `autoRestart` property of the `KafkaConnector` resource to enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks.

If you prefer, you can also set a maximum limit on the number of restarts.

Additionally, you could set a maximum limit on the backoff time.

For MirrorMaker 2, use the `autoRestart` property of connectors in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource to enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks.
