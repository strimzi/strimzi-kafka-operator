Configures automatic restarts for connectors and tasks that are in a `FAILED` state.

When enabled, a back-off algorithm applies the automatic restart to each failed connector and its tasks.
An incremental back-off interval is calculated using the formula `n * n + n` where `n` represents the number of previous restarts.
This interval is capped at a maximum of 60 minutes.
Consequently, a restart occurs immediately, followed by restarts after 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56 minutes, and then at 60-minute intervals.
By default, Strimzi initiates restarts of the connector and its tasks indefinitely.
However, you can use the `maxRestarts` property to set a maximum on the number of restarts.
If `maxRestarts` is configured and the connector still fails even after the final restart attempt, you must then restart the connector manually.

For Kafka Connect connectors, use the `autoRestart` property of the `KafkaConnector` resource to enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks.

If you prefer, you can also set a maximum limit on the number of restarts.

For MirrorMaker 2, use the `autoRestart` property of connectors in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource to enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks.
