Configures access control rules for a `KafkaUser` when brokers are using the `AclAuthorizer`.

[id='property-acl-resource-{context}']
=== `resource`

Use the `resource` property to specify the resource that the rule applies to.

Simple authorization supports four resource types, which are specified in the `type` property:

* Topics (`topic`)
* Consumer Groups (`group`)
* Clusters (`cluster`)
* Transactional IDs (`transactionalId`)

For Topic, Group, and Transactional ID resources you can specify the name of the resource the rule applies to in the `name` property.

Cluster type resources have no name.

A name is specified as a `literal` or a `prefix` using the `patternType` property.

* Literal names are taken exactly as they are specified in the `name` field.
* Prefix names use the `name` value as a prefix and then apply the rule to all resources with names starting with that value.

When `patternType` is set as `literal`, you can set the name to `*` to indicate that the rule applies to all resources.

    acls:
      - resource:
          type: topic

[id='property-acl-type-{context}']
=== `type`

The `type` of rule, which is to `allow` or `deny` (not currently supported) an operations.

The `type` field is optional.
If `type` is unspecified, the ACL rule is treated as an `allow` rule.

[id='property-acl-operation-{context}']
=== `operations`

Specify a list of `operations` for the rule to allow or deny.

The following operations are supported:

* Read
* Write
* Delete
* Alter
* Describe
* All
* IdempotentWrite
* ClusterAction
* Create
* AlterConfigs
* DescribeConfigs

Only certain operations work with each resource.

For more details about `AclAuthorizer`, ACLs and supported combinations of resources and operations, see link:http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_authz[Authorization and ACLs^].

[id='property-acl-host-{context}']
=== `host`

Use the `host` property to specify a remote host from which the rule is allowed or denied.

Use an asterisk (`\*`) to allow or deny the operation from all hosts.
The `host` field is optional. If `host` is unspecified, the `*` value is used by default.
