Configures a MirrorMaker consumer.

[id='property-consumer-streams-{context}']
.`numStreams`

Use the `consumer.numStreams` property to configure the number of streams for the consumer.

You can increase the throughput in mirroring topics by increasing the number of consumer threads.
Consumer threads belong to the consumer group specified for Kafka MirrorMaker.
Topic partitions are assigned across the consumer threads, which consume messages in parallel.

[id='property-consumer-offset-autocommit-{context}']
.`offsetCommitInterval`

Use the `consumer.offsetCommitInterval` property to configure an offset auto-commit interval for the consumer.

You can specify the regular time interval at which an offset is committed after Kafka MirrorMaker has consumed data from the source Kafka cluster.
The time interval is set in milliseconds, with a default value of 60,000.

[id='property-consumer-config-{context}']
.`config`

Use the `consumer.config` properties to configure Kafka options for the consumer.

The `config` property contains the Kafka MirrorMaker consumer configuration options as keys, with values set in one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

For client connection using a specific _cipher suite_ for a TLS version, you can xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[configure allowed `ssl` properties].
You can also xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[configure the `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` property] to enable or disable hostname verification.

*Exceptions*

You can specify and configure the options listed in the {ApacheKafkaConsumerConfig}.

However, there are exceptions for options automatically configured and managed directly by Strimzi related to:

* Kafka cluster bootstrap address
* Security (encryption, authentication, and authorization)
* Consumer group identifier
* Interceptors

Specifically, all configuration options with keys equal to or starting with one of the following strings are forbidden:

* `bootstrap.servers`
* `group.id`
* `interceptor.classes`
* `ssl.` (xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[not including specific exceptions])
* `sasl.`
* `security.`

When a forbidden option is present in the `config` property, it is ignored and a warning message is printed to the Cluster Operator log file.
All other options are passed to Kafka MirrorMaker.

IMPORTANT: The Cluster Operator does not validate keys or values in the provided `config` object.
When an invalid configuration is provided, the Kafka MirrorMaker might not start or might become unstable.
In such cases, the configuration in the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.consumer.config` object should be fixed and the Cluster Operator will roll out the new configuration for Kafka MirrorMaker.

[id='property-consumer-group-{context}']
.`groupId`

Use the `consumer.groupId` property to configure a consumer group identifier for the consumer.

Kafka MirrorMaker uses a Kafka consumer to consume messages, behaving like any other Kafka consumer client.
Messages consumed from the source Kafka cluster are mirrored to a target Kafka cluster.
A group identifier is required, as the consumer needs to be part of a consumer group for the assignment of partitions.
