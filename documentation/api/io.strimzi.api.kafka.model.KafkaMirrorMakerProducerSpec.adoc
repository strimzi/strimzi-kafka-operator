Configures a MirrorMaker producer.

[id='property-producer-abort-on-send-{context}']
.`abortOnSendFailure`

Use the `producer.abortOnSendFailure` property to configure how to handle message send failure from the producer.

By default, if an error occurs when sending a message from Kafka MirrorMaker to a Kafka cluster:

* The Kafka MirrorMaker container is terminated in Kubernetes.
* The container is then recreated.

If the `abortOnSendFailure` option is set to `false`, message sending errors are ignored.

[id='property-producer-config-{context}']
.`config`

Use the `producer.config` properties to configure Kafka options for the producer.

The `config` property contains the Kafka MirrorMaker producer configuration options as keys, with values set in one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

For client connection using a specific _cipher suite_ for a TLS version, you can xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[configure allowed `ssl` properties].
You can also xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[configure the `ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm` property] to enable or disable hostname verification.

*Exceptions*

You can specify and configure the options listed in the {ApacheKafkaProducerConfig}.

However, there are exceptions for options automatically configured and managed directly by Strimzi related to:

* Kafka cluster bootstrap address
* Security (encryption, authentication, and authorization)
* Interceptors

Specifically, all configuration options with keys equal to or starting with one of the following strings are forbidden:

* `bootstrap.servers`
* `interceptor.classes`
* `ssl.` (xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[not including specific exceptions])
* `sasl.`
* `security.`

When a forbidden option is present in the `config` property, it is ignored and a warning message is printed to the Cluster Operator log file.
All other options are passed to Kafka MirrorMaker.

IMPORTANT: The Cluster Operator does not validate keys or values in the provided `config` object.
When an invalid configuration is provided, the Kafka MirrorMaker might not start or might become unstable.
In such cases, the configuration in the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.producer.config` object should be fixed and the Cluster Operator will roll out the new configuration for Kafka MirrorMaker.
