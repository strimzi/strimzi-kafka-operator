Configures rack awareness to spread partition replicas across different racks.

A _rack_ can represent an availability zone, data center, or an actual rack in your data center.
By configuring a `rack` for a Kafka cluster, consumers can fetch data from the closest replica.
This is useful for reducing the load on your network when a Kafka cluster spans multiple datacenters.

To configure Kafka brokers for rack awareness, you specify a `topologyKey` value to match the label of the cluster node used by Kubernetes when scheduling Kafka broker pods to nodes.

If the Kubernetes cluster is running on a cloud provider platform, the label must represent the availability zone where the node is running.
Usually, nodes are labeled with the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label (or `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` on older Kubernetes versions),
which can be used as the `topologyKey` value.

The rack awareness configuration spreads the broker pods and partition replicas across zones, improving resiliency, and also sets a `broker.rack` configuration for each Kafka broker.
The `broker.rack` configuration assigns a rack ID to each broker.

Consult your Kubernetes administrator regarding the node label that represents the zone or rack into which the node is deployed.

.Example `rack` configuration for Kafka
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    rack:
      topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    config:
      # ...
      replica.selector.class: org.apache.kafka.common.replica.RackAwareReplicaSelector
    # ...
----

Use the `RackAwareReplicaSelector` implementation for the Kafka `ReplicaSelector` plugin if you want clients to consume from the closest replica.
The `ReplicaSelector` plugin provides the logic that enables clients to consume from the nearest replica.
Specify `RackAwareReplicaSelector` for the `replica.selector.class` to switch from the default implementation.
The default implementation uses `LeaderSelector` to always select the leader replica for the client.
By switching from the leader replica to the replica follower, there is some cost to latency.
If required, you can also customize your own implementation.

For clients, including Kafka Connect, you specify the same topology key as the broker that the client will use to consume messages.

.Example `rack` configuration for Kafka Connect
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
# ...
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    rack:
      topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    # ...
----

The client is assigned a `client.rack` ID.

`RackAwareReplicaSelector` associates matching `broker.rack` and `client.rack` IDs,
so the client can consume from the nearest replica.

If there are multiple replicas in the same rack, `RackAwareReplicaSelector` always selects the most up-to-date replica.
If the rack ID is not specified, or if it cannot find a replica with the same rack ID, it will fall back to the leader replica.
