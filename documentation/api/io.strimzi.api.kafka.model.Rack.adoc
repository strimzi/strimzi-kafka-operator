The `rack` option configures rack awareness.
A _rack_ can represent an availability zone, data center, or an actual rack in your data center.
The _rack_ is configured through a `topologyKey`.
`topologyKey` identifies a label on Kubernetes nodes that contains the name of the topology in its value.
An example of such a label is `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` (or `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` on older Kubernetes versions), which contains the name of the availability zone in which the Kubernetes node runs.
You can configure your Kafka cluster to be aware of the _rack_ in which it runs, and enable additional features such as spreading partition replicas across different racks or consuming messages from the closest replicas.

For more information about Kubernetes node labels, see {K8sWellKnownLabelsAnnotationsAndTaints}.
Consult your Kubernetes administrator regarding the node label that represents the zone or rack into which the node is deployed.

=== Spreading partition replicas across racks

When rack awareness is configured, Strimzi will set `broker.rack` configuration for each Kafka broker.
The `broker.rack` configuration assigns a rack ID to each broker.
When `broker.rack` is configured, Kafka brokers will spread partition replicas across as many different racks as possible.
When replicas are spread across multiple racks, the probability that multiple replicas will fail at the same time is lower than if they would be in the same rack.
Spreading replicas improves resiliency, and is important for availability and reliability.
To enable rack awareness in Kafka, add the `rack` option to the `.spec.kafka` section of the `Kafka` custom resource as shown in the example below.

.Example `rack` configuration for Kafka
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    rack:
      topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    # ...
----

NOTE: The _rack_ in which brokers are running can change in some cases when the pods are deleted or restarted.
As a result, the replicas running in different racks might then share the same rack.
Use Cruise Control and the `KafkaRebalance` resource with the `RackAwareGoal` to make sure that replicas remain distributed across different racks.

When rack awareness is enabled in the `Kafka` custom resource, Strimzi will automatically add the Kubernetes `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` affinity rule to distribute the Kafka brokers across the different racks.
However, the _preferred_ rule does not guarantee that the brokers will be spread.
Depending on your exact Kubernetes and Kafka configurations, you should add additional `affinity` rules or configure `topologySpreadConstraints` for both ZooKeeper and Kafka to make sure the nodes are properly distributed accross as many racks as possible.
For more information see xref:assembly-scheduling-str[].

=== Consuming messages from the closest replicas

Rack awareness can also be used in consumers to fetch data from the closest replica.
This is useful for reducing the load on your network when a Kafka cluster spans multiple datacenters and can also reduce costs when running Kafka in public clouds.
However, it can lead to increased latency.

In order to be able to consume from the closest replica, rack awareness has to be configured in the Kafka cluster, and the `RackAwareReplicaSelector` has to be enabled.
The replica selector plugin provides the logic that enables clients to consume from the nearest replica.
The default implementation uses `LeaderSelector` to always select the leader replica for the client.
Specify `RackAwareReplicaSelector` for the `replica.selector.class` to switch from the default implementation.

.Example `rack` configuration with enabled replica-aware selector
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    rack:
      topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    config:
      # ...
      replica.selector.class: org.apache.kafka.common.replica.RackAwareReplicaSelector
    # ...
----

In addition to the Kafka broker configuration, you also need to specify the `client.rack` option in your consumers.
The `client.rack` option should specify the _rack ID_ in which the consumer is running.
`RackAwareReplicaSelector` associates matching `broker.rack` and `client.rack` IDs, to find the nearest replica and consume from it.
If there are multiple replicas in the same rack, `RackAwareReplicaSelector` always selects the most up-to-date replica.
If the rack ID is not specified, or if it cannot find a replica with the same rack ID, it will fall back to the leader replica.

You can also configure Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker 2.0 and Kafka Bridge so that connectors consume messages from the closest replicas.
You enable rack awareness in the `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaMirrorMaker2`, and `KafkaBridge` custom resources.
The configuration does does not set affinity rules, but you can also configure `affinity` or `topologySpreadConstraints`.
For more information see xref:assembly-scheduling-str[].

When deploying Kafka Connect using Strimzi, you can use the `rack` section in the `KafkaConnect` custom resource to automatically configure the `client.rack` option.

----
apiVersion: {KafkaConnectApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect

spec:
  # ...

When deploying MirrorMaker 2 using Strimzi, you can use the `rack` section in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource to automatically configure the `client.rack` option.

.Example `rack` configuration for MirrorMaker 2.0

When deploying Kafka Bridge using Strimzi, you can use the `rack` section in the `KafkaBridge` custom resource to automatically configure the `client.rack` option.
