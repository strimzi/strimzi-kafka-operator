To configure custom authentication, set the `type` property to `custom`.
Custom authentication allows for any type of Kafka-supported authentication to be used.
It is especially useful with 3rd party Apache Kafka services - such as Amazon MSK - that use their own authentication mechanisms.

.Example custom authentication configuration using the `AWS_MSK_IAM` authentication
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
  authentication:
    type: custom
    sasl: true
    config:
      sasl.mechanism: AWS_MSK_IAM
      sasl.jaas.config: software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMLoginModule required;
      sasl.client.callback.handler.class: software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler
----

The `config` section accepts only options starting with the prefix `sasl.` and `ssl.keystore.`.
All other options will be ignored.
If you need to configure additional options, please use the other parts (such as `.spec.config` or `.spec.tls`) in the corresponding Strimzi custom resource.
The `security.protocol` is automatically generated based on the `sasl` field and the `tls` section of the corresponding Strimzi custom resource.

* SASL = True, TLS = True -> SASL_SSL
* SASL = False, TLS = True -> SSL
* SASL = True, TLS = False -> SASL_PLAINTEXT
* SASL = False, TLS = False -> PLAINTEXT

= Using Secrets in custom authentication

If your custom authentication mechanism requires additional information from Secrets or Config Maps, you can use the link:{BookURLConfiguring}#con-common-configuration-volumes-reference[Additional Volumes^] feature to mount them into the operands.
Kafka Configuration Providers can be used to load them from the disk.

= Using additional authentication plugins

Custom authentication mechanisms will often require custom plugins to be added to the operand.
You can add them using the link:{BookURLConfiguring}#con-common-configuration-volumes-reference[Additional Volumes^] feature.
Or by building a custom container image.
