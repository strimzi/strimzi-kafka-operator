== Cluster Controller

The cluster controller is in charge of deploying a Kafka cluster alongside a Zookeeper ensemble. As part of the Kafka cluster,
it can also deploy the topic controller which provides operator-style topic management via ConfigMaps.
The cluster controller is also able to deploy a Kafka Connect cluster which connects to an existing Kafka cluster.
On OpenShift such a cluster can be deployed using the Source2Image feature, providing an easy way of including more connectors.

image::cluster_controller.png[Cluster Controller]

When the cluster controller is up, it starts to "watch" for ConfigMaps containing the Kafka or Kafka Connect
cluster configuration. Such ConfigMaps need to have a specific label which is, by default, `strimzi.io/kind=cluster`
(as described <<Format of the cluster ConfigMap,later>>) that can be changed through a corresponding environment variable.

When a new ConfigMap is created in the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, the controller gets the cluster configuration from
its `data` section and starts creating a new Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster by creating the necessary Kubernetes/OpenShift
resources, such as StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Services etc.

Every time the ConfigMap is updated by the user with some changes in the `data` section, the controller performs corresponding
updates on the Kubernetes/OpenShift resources which make up the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster. Resources are either patched
or deleted and then re-created in order to make the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster reflect the state of the cluster ConfigMap.
This might cause a rolling update which might lead to service disruption.

Finally, when the ConfigMap is deleted, the controller starts to un-deploy the cluster deleting all the related Kubernetes/OpenShift
resources.

=== Reconciliation

Although the controller reacts to all notifications about the cluster ConfigMaps received from the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster,
if the controller is not running, or if a notification is not received for any reason, the ConfigMaps will get out of sync
with the state of the running Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.

In order to handle failovers properly, a periodic reconciliation process is executed by the cluster controller so
that it can compare the state of the ConfigMaps with the current cluster deployment in order to have
a consistent state across all of them.

[[config_map_details]]
=== Format of the cluster ConfigMap

The controller watches for ConfigMaps having the label `strimzi.io/kind=cluster` in order to find and get
configuration for a Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster to deploy.

In order to distinguish which "type" of cluster to deploy, Kafka or Kafka Connect, the controller checks the
`strimzi.io/type` label which can have one of the the following values :

* `kafka`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka cluster (with Zookeeper ensemble) deployment
* `kafka-connect`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment
* `kafka-connect-s2i`: the ConfigMap provides configuration for a Kafka Connect cluster deployment using Build and Source2Image
features (works only with OpenShift)

Whatever other labels are applied to the ConfigMap will also be applied to the Kubernetes/OpenShift resources making
up the Kafka or Kafka Connect cluster. This provides a convenient mechanism for those resource to be labelled
in whatever way the user requires.

The `data` section of such ConfigMaps contains different keys depending on the "type" of deployment as described in the 
following sections.

[[kafka_config_map_details]]
==== Kafka

In order to configure a Kafka cluster deployment, it's possible to specify the following fields in the `data` section of 
the related ConfigMap :

* `kafka-nodes`: number of Kafka broker nodes. Default is 3
* `kafka-image`: the Docker image to use for the Kafka brokers. Default is `strimzi/kafka:latest`
* `kafka-healthcheck-delay`: the initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka broker node. Default is 15
* `kafka-healthcheck-timeout`: the timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka broker node. Default is 5
* `zookeeper-nodes`: number of Zookeeper nodes
* `zookeeper-image`: the Docker image to use for the Zookeeper nodes. Default is `strimzi/zookeeper:latest`
* `zookeeper-healthcheck-delay`: the initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Zookeeper node. Default is 15
* `zookeeper-healthcheck-timeout`: the timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Zookeeper node. Default is 5
* `KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: the default replication factors for automatically created topics. It sets the 
`default.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka broker nodes on startup. Default is 3
* `KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: the replication factor for the offsets topic. It sets the  
`offsets.topic.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka broker nodes on startup. Default is 3
* `KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: the replication factor for the transaction topic. It sets the 
`transaction.state.log.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka broker nodes on startup. Default is 3
* `kafka-storage`: a JSON string representing the storage configuration for the Kafka broker nodes. See related section
* `zookeeper-storage`: a JSON string representing the storage configuration for the Zookeeper nodes. See related section
* `kafka-metrics-config`: a JSON string representing the JMX exporter configuration for exposing metrics from Kafka broker nodes.
 Removing this field means having no metrics exposed.
* `zookeeper-metrics-config`: a JSON string representing the JMX exporter configuration for exposing metrics from Zookeeper nodes.
 Removing this field means having no metrics exposed.
* `topic-controller-config`: a JSON string representing the topic controller configuration. See the <<topic_controller_json_config>>
documentation for further details. More info about the topic controller in the related <<Topic Controller>> documentation page.
 
The following is an example of a ConfigMap for a Kafka cluster.

The resources created by the cluster controller into the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster will be the following :

* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper` StatefulSet which is in charge to create the Zookeeper node pods
* `[cluster-name]-kafka` StatefulSet which is in charge to create the Kafka broker pods
* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper-headless` Service needed to have DNS resolve the Zookeeper pods IP addresses directly
* `[cluster-name]-kafka-headless` Service needed to have DNS resolve the Kafka broker pods IP addresses directly
* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper` Service used by Kafka brokers to connect to Zookeeper nodes as clients
* `[cluster-name]-kafka` Service can be used as bootstrap servers for Kafka clients
* `[cluster-name]-zookeeper-metrics-config` ConfigMap which contains the Zookeeper metrics configuration and mounted as
a volume by the Zookeeper node pods
* `[cluster-name]-kafka-metrics-config` ConfigMap which contains the Kafka metrics configuration and mounted as
a volume by the Kafka broker pods

===== Storage

Both Kafka and Zookeeper save data to files.

Strimzi allows to save such data in an "ephemeral" way (using `emptyDir`) or in a "persistent-claim" way using persistent
volumes.
It's possible to provide the storage configuration in the related ConfigMap using a JSON string as value for the 
`kafka-storage` and `zookeeper-storage` fields.

IMPORTANT: The `kafka-storage` and `zookeeper-storage` fields can't be changed when the cluster is up.

The JSON representation has a mandatory `type` field for specifying the type of storage to use ("ephemeral" or "persistent-claim").

The "ephemeral" storage is really simple to configure and the related JSON string has the following structure.

.Ephemeral storage JSON
[source,json]
----
{ "type": "ephemeral" }

----

In case of "persistent-claim" type the following fields can be provided as well :

* `size`: defines the size of the persistent volume claim (i.e 1Gi) - mandatory
* `class` : the Kubernetes/OpenShift https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[storage class] to use
for dynamic volume allocation - optional
* `selector`: allows to select a specific persistent volume to use. It contains a `matchLabels` field which defines an
inner JSON object with key:value representing labels for selecting such a volume - optional
* `delete-claim`: boolean value which specifies if the persistent volume claim has to be deleted when the cluster is un-deployed.
Default is `false` - optional

.Persistent storage JSON with 1Gi as size
[source,json]
----
{ "type": "persistent-claim", "size": "1Gi" }
----

This example demonstrates use of a storage class.

.Persistent storage JSON using "storage class"
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "persistent-claim",
  "size": "1Gi",
  "class": "my-storage-class"
}
----

Finally, a selector can be used in order to select a specific labeled persistent volume which provides some needed features (i.e. an SSD)

.Persistent storage JSON with "match labels" selector
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "persistent-claim",
  "size": "1Gi",
  "selector":
  {
    "matchLabels":
    {
      "hdd-type": "ssd"
    }
  },
  "delete-claim": true
}
----

When the "persistent-claim" is used, other than the resources already described in the <<Kafka>> section, the following resources
are generated :

* `data-[cluster-name]-kafka-[idx]` Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `[idx]`
* `data-[cluster-name]-zookeeper-[idx]` Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the
Zookeeper node pod `[idx]`

===== Metrics

Because Strimzi uses the [JMX exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) in order to expose metrics
on each node, the JSON string used for metrics configuration in the cluster ConfigMap reflects the related JMX exporter 
configuration file. For this reason, you can find more information on how to use it in the corresponding GitHub repo.

For more information about using the metrics with Prometheus and Grafana, see <<_metrics>>

[[topic_controller_json_config]]
===== Topic controller

Alongside the Kafka cluster and the Zookeeper ensemble, the cluster controller can also deploy the topic controller.
In order to do that, the 'topic-controller-config` field has to be put into the data section of the cluster ConfigMap.
This field is a JSON string containing the topic controller configuration.
Without this field, the cluster controller doesn't deploy the topic controller. It is still possible to deploy the topic
controller by creating appropriate Kubernetes/OpenShift resources.

The JSON representation of the 'topic-controller-config` has no mandatory fields and if the value is an empty object
(just "{ }"), the cluster controller will deploy the topic controller with a default configuration.

The configurable fields are the following :

`image`:: Docker image to use for the topic controller. Default is `strimzi/topic-controller:latest`
`watchedNamespace`:: The Kubernetes namespace (OpenShift project) in which the topic controller watches for topic ConfigMaps.
Default is the namespace where the topic controller is running
`reconciliationIntervalMs`:: The interval between periodic reconciliations in milliseconds. Default is 900000 (15 minutes).
`zookeeperSessionTimeoutMs`:: The Zookeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Default is 20000 milliseconds (20 seconds).
`topicMetadataMaxAttempts`:: The number of attempts for getting topics metadata from Kafka. The time between each attempt
 is defined as an exponential back-off. You might want to increase this value when topic creation could take more time due
 to its larger size (i.e. many partitions/replicas). Default `6`.

.Example Topic Controller JSON configuration

----
{ "reconciliationIntervalMs": "900000", "zookeeperSessionTimeoutMs": "20000" }
----

More information about these configuration parameters in the related <<Topic Controller>> documentation page.

[[kafka_connect_config_map_details]]
==== Kafka Connect

In order to configure a Kafka Connect cluster deployment, it's possible to specify the following fields in the `data` section of 
the related ConfigMap:

* `nodes`: number of Kafka Connect worker nodes. Default is 1
* `image`: the Docker image to use for the Kafka Connect workers. Default is `strimzi/kafka-connect:latest`. If S2I is used 
(only on OpenShift), then it should be the related S2I image.
* `healthcheck-delay`: the initial delay for the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node. Default is 60
* `healthcheck-timeout`: the timeout on the liveness and readiness probes for each Kafka Connect worker node. Default is 5
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`: a list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
It sets the `bootstrap.servers` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is `my-cluster-kafka:9092`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_GROUP_ID`: a unique string that identifies the Connect cluster group this worker belongs to.
It sets the `group.id` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is `my-connect-cluster`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_KEY_CONVERTER`: converter class used to convert keys between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form 
that is written to Kafka. It sets the `key.converter` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect 
worker nodes on startup. Default is `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_KEY_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE`: if Kafka Connect transformation on keys are with or without schemas.
It sets the `key.converter.schemas.enable` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is true
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_VALUE_CONVERTER`: converter class used to convert values between Kafka Connect format and the serialized form 
that is written to Kafka. It sets the `value.converter` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect 
worker nodes on startup. Default is `org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter`
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_VALUE_CONVERTER_SCHEMAS_ENABLE`: if Kafka Connect transformation on values are with or without schemas.
It sets the `value.converter.schemas.enable` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is true
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_CONFIG_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: replication factor used when creating the configuration storage topic.
It sets the `config.storage.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is 3
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_OFFSET_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: replication factor used when creating the offset storage topic.
It sets the `offset.storage.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is 3
* `KAFKA_CONNECT_STATUS_STORAGE_REPLICATION_FACTOR`: replication factor used when creating the status storage topic.
It sets the `status.storage.replication.factor` property in the properties configuration file used by Kafka Connect worker nodes on startup.
Default is 3

The resources created by the cluster controller into the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster will be the following :

* [connect-cluster-name]-connect Deployment which is in charge to create the Kafka Connect worker node pods
* [connect-cluster-name]-connect Service which exposes the REST interface for managing the Kafka Connect cluster

=== Provisioning Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the controller

For the controller to function it needs permission within the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster to interact with
the resources it manages (ConfigMaps, Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, Services etc).
Such permission is described in terms of Kubernetes/OpenShift role-based access controls.

==== Using a ServiceAccount

The controller is best run using a ServiceAccount:

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example ServiceAccount for the Cluster Controller
----
include::../../examples/install/cluster-controller/01-service-account.yaml[]
----

The Deployment of the controller then needs to specify this in the `serviceAccountName` of its `template`´s
 `spec`:

[source,yaml,numbered,options="nowrap",highlight='12']
.Partial example Deployment for the Cluster Controller
----
include::../../examples/install/cluster-controller/04-deployment.yaml[lines=1..13]
# etc ...
----

Note line 12, where the the `strimzi-cluster-controller` ServiceAccount is specified as the `serviceAccountName`.

==== Defining a Role

The controller needs to operate using a Role that gives it access to the necessary resources

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example Role for the Cluster Controller
----
include::../../examples/install/cluster-controller/02-role.yaml[]
----


==== Defining a RoleBinding

Finally, the controller needs a RoleBinding which associates its Role with its ServiceAccount

[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
.Example RoleBinding for the Cluster Controller
----
include::../../examples/install/cluster-controller/03-role-binding.yaml[]
----

=== Controller configuration

The controller itself can be configured through the following environment variables.

`STRIMZI_NAMESPACE`:: Required. A comma-separated list of namespaces that the controller should operate in. The Cluster Controller deployment might use the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/#the-downward-api[Kubernetes Downward API]
to set this automatically to the namespace the Cluster Controller is deployed in. See the example below:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap"]
----
env:
  - name: STRIMZI_NAMESPACE
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.namespace
----

`STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS`:: Optional, default: 120000 ms. The interval between periodic reconciliations, in milliseconds.


`STRIMZI_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`:: Optional, default: 60000 ms. The timeout for internal operations, in milliseconds. This value should be
increased when using Strimzi on clusters where regular Kubernetes operations take longer than usual (because of slow downloading of Docker images, for example). 

[[multi-namespace]]
==== Watching multiple namespaces

The `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable can be used to configure a single controller instance
to operate in multiple namespaces. For each namespace given, the controller will watch for cluster ConfigMaps
and perform periodic reconciliation. To be able to do this, the controller's ServiceAccount needs
access to the necessary resources in those other namespaces. This can be done by creating an additional
RoleBinding in each of those namespaces, associating the controller's ServiceAccount
(`strimzi-cluster-controller` in the examples) with the controller's
Role (`strimzi-controller-role` in the examples).

Suppose, for example, that a controller deployed in namespace `foo` needs to operate in namespace `bar`.
The following RoleBinding would grant the necessary permissions:

.Example RoleBinding for a controller to operate in namespace `bar`
