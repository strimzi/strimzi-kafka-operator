= Topic Operator

The Topic Operator provides a way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster through Kubernetes resources.

.Example architecture for the Topic Operator

image:topic-operator.png[The Topic Operator manages topics for a Kafka cluster via KafkaTopic resources]

The role of the Topic Operator is to keep a set of `KafkaTopic` Kubernetes resources describing Kafka topics in-sync with corresponding Kafka topics.

Specifically, if a `KafkaTopic` is:

* Created, the Topic Operator creates the topic
* Deleted, the Topic Operator deletes the topic
* Changed, the Topic Operator updates the topic

Working in the other direction, if a topic is:

* Created within the Kafka cluster, the Operator creates a `KafkaTopic`
* Deleted from the Kafka cluster, the Operator deletes the `KafkaTopic`
* Changed in the Kafka cluster, the Operator updates the `KafkaTopic`

This allows you to declare a `KafkaTopic` as part of your application's deployment and the Topic Operator will take care of creating the topic for you.
Your application just needs to deal with producing or consuming from the necessary topics.

If the topic is reconfigured or reassigned to different Kafka nodes, the `KafkaTopic` will always be up to date.
