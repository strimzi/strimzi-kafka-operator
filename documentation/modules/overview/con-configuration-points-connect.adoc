= Kafka Connect configuration

A basic Kafka Connect configuration requires a bootstrap address to connect to a Kafka cluster, and encryption and authentication details.

Kafka Connect instances are configured by default with the same:

* Group ID for the Kafka Connect cluster
* Kafka topic to store the connector offsets
* Kafka topic to store connector and task status configurations
* Kafka topic to store connector and task status updates

If multiple different Kafka Connect instances are used, these settings must reflect each instance.

== Connectors

Connectors are configured separately from Kafka Connect.
The configuration describes the source input data and target output data to feed into and out of Kafka Connect.
The external source data must reference specific topics that will store the messages.

Kafka provides two built-in connectors:

--
* `FileStreamSourceConnector` streams data from an external system to Kafka, reading lines from an input source and sending each line to a Kafka topic.
* `FileStreamSinkConnector` streams data from Kafka to an external system, reading messages from a Kafka topic and creating a line for each in an output file.
--

You can add other connectors using connector plugins, which are a set of JAR files, TGZ or ZIP archives that define the implementation required to connect to certain types of external system.
You can also specify a Maven coordinates to fetch plugin from the Maven repository.

You create a custom Kafka Connect image that uses new connector plugins.

To create the image, you can use:

* Kafka Connect configuration so that Strimzi creates the new image automatically.
* A Kafka container image from {DockerRepository} as a base image.

For Strimzi to create the new image automatically, a `build` configuration requires `output` properties to reference a container registry that stores the container image,
and `plugins` properties to list the connector plugins and their artifacts to add to the image.

The `output` properties describe the type and name of the image, and optionally the name of the Secret containing the credentials needed to access the container registry.
The `plugins` properties describe the type of artifact and the URL from which the artifact is downloaded. Additionally, you can specify a SHA-512 checksum to verify the artifact before unpacking it.

== Managing connectors

You can use the KafkaConnector resource or the link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect_rest[Kafka Connect REST API] to create and manage connector instances in a Kafka Connect cluster.
The KafkaConnector resource offers a Kubernetes-native approach, and is managed by the Cluster Operator.

The `spec` for the KafkaConnector resource specifies the connector class and configuration settings, as well as the maximum number of connector _tasks_ to handle the data.

----

You enable KafkaConnectors by adding an annotation to the `KafkaConnect` resource.
KafkaConnector resources must be deployed to the same namespace as the Kafka Connect cluster they link to.
