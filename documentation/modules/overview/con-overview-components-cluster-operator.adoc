= Cluster Operator

Strimzi uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage clusters for:

* Kafka (including ZooKeeper, Entity Operator, Kafka Exporter, and Cruise Control)
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka MirrorMaker
* Kafka Bridge

Custom resources are used to deploy the clusters.

For example, to deploy a Kafka cluster:

* A `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration is created within the Kubernetes cluster.
* The Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster, based on what is declared in the `Kafka` resource.

The Cluster Operator can also deploy (through configuration of the `Kafka` resource):

* A Topic Operator to provide operator-style topic management through `KafkaTopic` custom resources
* A User Operator to provide operator-style user management through `KafkaUser` custom resources

The Topic Operator and User Operator function within the Entity Operator on deployment.
