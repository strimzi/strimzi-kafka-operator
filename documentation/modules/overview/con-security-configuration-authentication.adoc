= Authentication
Kafka listeners use authentication to ensure a secure client connection to the Kafka cluster.

Supported authentication mechanisms:

* TLS client authentication
* SASL SCRAM-SHA-512
* OAuth 2.0 token based authentication

The User Operator manages user credentials for TLS and SCRAM authentication, but not OAuth 2.0.
For example, through the User Operator you can create a user representing a client that requires access to the Kafka cluster, and specify TLS as the authentication type.

Using OAuth 2.0 token based authentication, application clients can access Kafka brokers without exposing account credentials.
An authorization server handles the granting of access and inquiries about access.
