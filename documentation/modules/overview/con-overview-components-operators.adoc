Cluster Operator:: Deploys and manages Apache Kafka clusters, Kafka Connect, Kafka MirrorMaker, Kafka Bridge, Kafka Exporter, Cruise Control, and the Entity Operator
Entity Operator:: Comprises the Topic Operator and User Operator
Topic Operator:: Manages Kafka topics

The Cluster Operator can deploy the Topic Operator and User Operator as part of an *Entity Operator* configuration at the same time as a Kafka cluster.
