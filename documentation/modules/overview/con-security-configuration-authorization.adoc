= Authorization

You can apply authorization to a Kafka cluster using `AclAuthorizer`.
If applied to a Kafka cluster, authorization is enabled for all listeners used for client connection.

`AclAuthorizer` uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to define which users have access to which resources.

_Super users_ provide user access to all resources in a Kafka cluster or to a specific broker.
