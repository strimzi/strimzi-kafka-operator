= Disabling FIPS mode

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi automatically switches to FIPS mode when running on a FIPS-enabled Kubernetes cluster.
Disable FIPS mode by setting the `FIPS_MODE` environment variable to `disabled` in the deployment configuration for the Cluster Operator.
With FIPS mode disabled, Strimzi automatically disables FIPS in the OpenJDK for all components.
With FIPS mode disabled, Strimzi is not FIPS compliant.
The Strimzi operators, as well as all operands, run in the same way as if they were running on an Kubernetes cluster without FIPS enabled.

.Procedure

. To disable the FIPS mode in the Cluster Operator, update its `Deployment` configuration (`install/cluster-operator/060-Deployment-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml`) and add the `FIPS_MODE` environment variable.
