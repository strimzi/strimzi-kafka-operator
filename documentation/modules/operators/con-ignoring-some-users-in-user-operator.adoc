= Ignoring some users

In some scenarios, it might be useful to have the User Operator ignore the ACLs, Quotas or SCRAM-SHA credentials for specific users.
This might include _special_ built-in users such as `ANONYMOUS` or `*`.
Or some internal users whose ACLs, Quotas or SCRAM-SHA credentials are managed through different mechanisms.

The environment variable `STRIMZI_IGNORED_USERS_PATTERN` in your User Operator deployment can be used specify a regular expression pattern that defines which users would be ignored.
For example, to set it to ignore the `ANONYMOUS` or `\*` users, set it to `^\*|ANONYMOUS$`.
You can set the environment variable in your `Kafka` custom resource (`.spec.teplate.entityOperator.userOperatorContainer.env`) or in the `Deployment` resource of your standalone User Operator.
For example:
