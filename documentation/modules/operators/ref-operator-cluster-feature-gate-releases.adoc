= Feature gate releases

[role="_abstract"]
Feature gates have three stages of maturity:

* Alpha — typically disabled by default
* Beta — typically enabled by default
* General Availability (GA) — typically always enabled

Alpha stage features might be experimental or unstable, subject to change, or not sufficiently tested for production use.
Beta stage features are well tested and their functionality is not likely to change.
GA stage features are stable and should not change in the future.
Alpha and beta stage features are removed if they do not prove to be useful.

* The `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate moved to GA stage in Strimzi 0.32. It is now permanently enabled and cannot be disabled.
* The `ServiceAccountPatching` feature gate moved to GA stage in Strimzi 0.30. It is now permanently enabled and cannot be disabled.
* The `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate moved to beta stage in Strimzi 0.30.
  It moves to GA in Strimzi 0.35 when the support for StatefulSets is completely removed.
* The `UseKRaft` feature gate is available for development only and does not currently have a planned release for moving to the beta phase.

NOTE: Feature gates might be removed when they reach GA. This means that the feature was incorporated into the Strimzi core features and can no longer be disabled.

If a feature gate is enabled, you may need to disable it before upgrading or downgrading from a specific Strimzi version.
The following table shows which feature gates you need to disable when upgrading or downgrading Strimzi versions.
