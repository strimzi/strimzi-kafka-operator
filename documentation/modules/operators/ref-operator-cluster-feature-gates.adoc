= Feature gates

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi operators use feature gates to enable or disable specific features and functions.
Enabling a feature gate alters the behavior of the associated operator, introducing the corresponding feature to your Strimzi deployment.

The purpose of feature gates is to facilitate the trial and testing of a feature before it is fully adopted. 
The state (enabled or disabled) of a feature gate may vary by default, depending on its maturity level.

As a feature gate graduates and reaches General Availability (GA), it transitions to an enabled state by default and becomes a permanent part of the Strimzi deployment.
A feature gate at the GA stage cannot be disabled.

The supported feature gates are applicable to all Strimzi operators.
While a particular feature gate might be used by one operator and ignored by the others, it can still be configured in all operators.
When deploying the User Operator and Topic Operator within the context of the `Kafka` custom resource, the Cluster Operator automatically propagates the feature gates configuration to them.
When the User Operator and Topic Operator are deployed standalone, without a Cluster Operator available to configure the feature gates, they must be directly configured within their deployments.

== Feature gate releases

[role="_abstract"]
Feature gates have three stages of maturity:

Alpha:: Alpha stage features are typically disabled by default. +
They might be experimental or unstable, subject to change, or not sufficiently tested for production use.

Beta:: Beta stage features are typically enabled by default. +
They are well tested and their functionality is not likely to change.

General Availability (GA):: GA features are typically always enabled. +
They are stable and should not change in the future.
Feature gates might be removed when they reach GA, which means that the feature was incorporated into the Strimzi core features.

Alpha and beta stage features are removed if they do not prove to be useful.
When a feature gate reaches GA, it is permanently enabled and can no longer be disabled. 
The following table shows the maturity of the feature gates introduced across Strimzi versions.

== Graduated feature gates (GA)

For information on feature gates that have reached GA, see the documentation for the Strimzi version in which they were introduced.

== Stable feature gates (Beta)

Stable feature gates have reached a beta level of maturity, and are generally enabled by default for all users.
Stable feature gates are production-ready, but they can still be disabled.

=== ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure feature gate

The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate has a default state of _enabled_.

The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate allows the Cluster Operator to continue a reconciliation if the manual rolling update of the operands fails.
It applies to the following operands that support manual rolling updates using the `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` annotation:

* Kafka
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka MirrorMaker 2

Continuing the reconciliation after a manual rolling update failure allows the operator to recover from various situations that might prevent the update from succeeding.
For example, a missing Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) or Persistent Volume (PV) might cause the manual rolling update to fail.
However, the PVCs and PVs are created only in a later stage of the reconciliation.
By continuing the reconciliation after this failure, the process can recreate the missing PVC or PV and recover.

The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate is used by the Cluster Operator.
It is ignored by the User and Topic Operators.

.Disabling the ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure feature gate
To disable the `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate, specify `-ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` in the `STRIMZI_FEATURE_GATES` environment variable in the Cluster Operator configuration.

== Early access feature gates (Alpha)

Early access feature gates have not yet reached the beta stage, and are disabled by default. 
An early access feature gate provides an opportunity for assessment before its functionality is permanently incorporated into Strimzi.
Currently, there are no alpha level feature gates.

== Enabling feature gates

To modify a feature gate's default state, use the `STRIMZI_FEATURE_GATES` environment variable in the operator's configuration.
You can modify multiple feature gates using this single environment variable.
Specify a comma-separated list of feature gate names and prefixes.
A `+` prefix enables the feature gate and a `-` prefix  disables it.
