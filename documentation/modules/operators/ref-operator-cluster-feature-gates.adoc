= Feature gates

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi operators use feature gates to enable or disable specific features and functions.
Enabling a feature gate alters the behavior of the associated operator, introducing the corresponding feature to your Strimzi deployment.

The purpose of feature gates is to facilitate the trial and testing of a feature before it is fully adopted. 
The state (enabled or disabled) of a feature gate may vary by default, depending on its maturity level.

As a feature gate graduates and reaches General Availability (GA), it transitions to an enabled state by default and becomes a permanent part of the Strimzi deployment.
A feature gate at the GA stage cannot be disabled.

The supported feature gates are applicable to all Strimzi operators.
While a particular feature gate might be used by one operator and ignored by the others, it can still be configured in all operators.
When deploying the User Operator and Topic Operator within the context of the`Kafka` custom resource, the Cluster Operator automatically propagates the feature gates configuration to them.
When the User Operator and Topic Operator are deployed standalone, without a Cluster Operator available to configure the feature gates, they must be directly configured within their deployments.

== Graduated feature gates (GA)

Graduated feature gates have reached General Availability (GA) and are permanently enabled features.

=== ControlPlaneListener feature gate

The `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate separates listeners for data replication and coordination:

* Connections between the Kafka controller and brokers use an internal _control plane listener_ on port 9090.
* Replication of data between brokers, as well as internal connections from Strimzi operators, Cruise Control, or the Kafka Exporter use a _replication listener_ on port 9091.

IMPORTANT: With the `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate permanently enabled, direct upgrades or downgrades between Strimzi 0.22 and earlier and Strimzi 0.32 and newer are not possible.
You must first upgrade or downgrade through one of the Strimzi versions in-between, disable the `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate, and then downgrade or upgrade (with the feature gate enabled) to the target version.

=== ServiceAccountPatching feature gate

The `ServiceAccountPatching` feature gate ensures that the Cluster Operator always reconciles service accounts and updates them when needed.
For example, when you change service account labels or annotations using the `template` property of a custom resource, the operator automatically updates them on the existing service account resources.

[id='ref-operator-use-strimzi-pod-sets-feature-gate-{context}']
=== UseStrimziPodSets feature gate

The `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate introduced the `StrimziPodSet` custom resource for managing Kafka pods, replacing the use of Kubernetes `StatefulSet` resources.

IMPORTANT: With the `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate permanently enabled, direct downgrades from Strimzi 0.35 and newer to Strimzi 0.27 or earlier are not possible.
You must first downgrade through one of the Strimzi versions in-between, disable the `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate, and then downgrade to Strimzi 0.27 or earlier.
Before upgrading from Strimzi 0.34.0 or older to 0.46.0 or newer, make sure the `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate is enabled and `StrimziPodSet` resources are in use for Kafka.

[id='ref-operator-stable-connect-identities-feature-gate-{context}']
=== StableConnectIdentities feature gate

The `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate introduced the `StrimziPodSet` custom resource for managing Kafka Connect and Kafka MirrorMaker 2 pods, replacing the use of Kubernetes `Deployment` resources.

`StrimziPodSet` resources give the pods stable names and stable addresses, which do not change during rolling upgrades, replacing the use of Kubernetes `Deployment` resources.

IMPORTANT: With the `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate permanently enabled, direct downgrades from Strimzi 0.39 and newer to Strimzi 0.33 or earlier are not possible.
You must first downgrade through one of the Strimzi versions in-between, disable the `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate, and then downgrade to Strimzi 0.33 or earlier.
Before upgrading from Strimzi 0.38.0 or older to 0.46.0 or newer, make sure the `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate is enabled and `StrimziPodSet` resources are in use for Kafka Connect or Kafka MirrorMaker 2.

[id='ref-operator-kafka-node-pools-feature-gate-{context}']
=== KafkaNodePools feature gate

The `KafkaNodePools` feature gate introduced the `KafkaNodePool` custom resource, enabling the configuration of distinct _pools_ of Apache Kafka nodes within a Kafka cluster. 
Each pool can have its own unique configuration, as described in xref:config-node-pools-str[].

To use node pools, ensure the following configuration is present:

* The `strimzi.io/node-pools: enabled` annotation in the `Kafka` resource.
* The `strimzi.io/cluster: <cluster_name>` label in each `KafkaNodePool` resource to associate it with the `Kafka` resource.

Examples of the `KafkaNodePool` resources can be found in the xref:config-examples-{context}[example configuration files] provided by Strimzi.

.Downgrading from KafkaNodePools

KRaft-based Kafka clusters always use `KafkaNodePools`. 
Downgrading to a cluster without node pools is not possible.

[id='ref-operator-unidirectional-topic-operator-feature-gate-{context}']
=== UnidirectionalTopicOperator feature gate

The `UnidirectionalTopicOperator` feature gate introduced a unidirectional topic management mode for creating Kafka topics using the `KafkaTopic` resource.
Unidirectional mode is compatible with using KRaft for cluster management.
With unidirectional mode, you create Kafka topics using the `KafkaTopic` resource, which are then managed by the Topic Operator.
Any configuration changes to a topic outside the `KafkaTopic` resource are reverted.
For more information on topic management, see xref:ref-operator-topic-str[].

[id='ref-operator-use-kraft-feature-gate-{context}']
=== UseKRaft feature gate

The `UseKRaft` feature gate introduced the KRaft (Kafka Raft metadata) mode for running Apache Kafka clusters without ZooKeeper.
ZooKeeper and KRaft are mechanisms used to manage metadata and coordinate operations in Kafka clusters.
KRaft mode eliminates the need for an external coordination service like ZooKeeper.
In KRaft mode, Kafka nodes take on the roles of brokers, controllers, or both.
They collectively manage the metadata, which is replicated across partitions.
Controllers are responsible for coordinating operations and maintaining the cluster's state.
For more information on using KRraft, see xref:assembly-kraft-mode-{context}[].

== Stable feature gates (Beta)

Stable feature gates have reached a beta level of maturity, and are generally enabled by default for all users.
Stable feature gates are production-ready, but they can still be disabled.

[id='ref-operator-continue-reconciliation-on-manual-ru-failure-feature-gate-{context}']
=== ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure feature gate

The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate has a default state of _enabled_.

The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate allows the Cluster Operator to continue a reconciliation if the manual rolling update of the operands fails.
It applies to the following operands that support manual rolling updates using the `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` annotation:

* Kafka
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka MirrorMaker 2

Continuing the reconciliation after a manual rolling update failure allows the operator to recover from various situations that might prevent the update from succeeding.
For example, a missing Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) or Persistent Volume (PV) might cause the manual rolling update to fail.
However, the PVCs and PVs are created only in a later stage of the reconciliation.
By continuing the reconciliation after this failure, the process can recreate the missing PVC or PV and recover.

The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate is used by the Cluster Operator.
It is ignored by the User and Topic Operators.

.Disabling the ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure feature gate
To disable the `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate, specify `-ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` in the `STRIMZI_FEATURE_GATES` environment variable in the Cluster Operator configuration.


== Early access feature gates (Alpha)

Early access feature gates have not yet reached the beta stage, and are disabled by default. 
An early access feature gate provides an opportunity for assessment before its functionality is permanently incorporated into Strimzi.
Currently, there are no alpha level feature gates.

== Enabling feature gates

To modify a feature gate's default state, use the `STRIMZI_FEATURE_GATES` environment variable in the operator's configuration.
You can modify multiple feature gates using this single environment variable.
Specify a comma-separated list of feature gate names and prefixes.
A `+` prefix enables the feature gate and a `-` prefix  disables it.
