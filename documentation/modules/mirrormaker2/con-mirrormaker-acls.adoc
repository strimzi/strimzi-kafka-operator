= ACL rules synchronization

ACL access to remote topics is possible if you are *not* using the User Operator.

If `AclAuthorizer` is being used, without the User Operator, ACL rules that manage access to brokers also apply to remote topics.
Users that can read a source topic can read its remote equivalent.

NOTE: OAuth 2.0 authorization does not support access to remote topics in this way.
