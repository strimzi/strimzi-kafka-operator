|Installation method
|Description

|xref:deploy-tasks_str[Deployment files (YAML files)]
a|xref:downloads-{context}[Download the deployment files] to manually deploy Strimzi components.
The installation files bundle all the necessary Kubernetes resources, including the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that define resources like `Kafka` and `KafkaTopic`, the RBAC roles for permissions, and the `Deployment` for the Cluster Operator itself.
This method offers the greatest flexibility and control.

|xref:deploying-strimzi-from-operator-hub-str[OperatorHub.io]
|Install Strimzi using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) from OperatorHub.io. 
Once the Cluster Operator is running, you can deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.
This method provides a standard configuration and supports automatic updates for streamlined lifecycle management.

ifdef::Section[]
|xref:deploying-cluster-operator-helm-chart-str[Helm chart]
|Use a Helm chart to deploy the Cluster Operator, then deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.
Helm charts offer a convenient and repeatable way to manage installations, especially in environments already using Helm.

NOTE: All deployment methods assume that you have access to a running Kubernetes cluster with appropriate permissions. Some methods may also require additional setup, such as access to container registries.
