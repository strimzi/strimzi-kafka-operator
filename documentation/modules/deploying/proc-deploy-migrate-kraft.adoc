= Migrating to KRaft mode

[role="_abstract"]
If you are using ZooKeeper for metadata management in your Kafka cluster, you can migrate to using Kafka in KRaft mode. 
KRaft mode replaces ZooKeeper for distributed coordination, offering enhanced reliability, scalability, and throughput.

During the migration, you install a quorum of controller nodes as a node pool, which replaces ZooKeeper for management of your cluster. 
You enable KRaft migration in the cluster configuration by applying the `strimzi.io/kraft="migration"` annotation.  
After the migration is complete, you switch the brokers to using KRaft and the controllers out of migration mode using the `strimzi.io/kraft="enabled"` annotation.

Before starting the migration, verify that your environment can support Kafka in KRaft mode, as there are a number of xref:ref-operator-use-kraft-feature-gate-str[limitations].
Note also, the following:

* Migration is only supported on dedicated controller nodes, not on nodes with dual roles as brokers and controllers.
* Throughout the migration process, ZooKeeper and controller nodes operate in parallel for a period, requiring sufficient compute resources in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You must be using Strimzi 0.40 or newer with Kafka 3.7.0 or newer. If you are using an earlier version of Strimzi or Apache Kafka, upgrade before migrating to KRaft mode.
* Verify that the ZooKeeper-based deployment is operating without the following, as they are not supported in KRaft mode:
** JBOD storage. While the `jbod` storage type can be used, the JBOD array must contain only one disk.
* The Cluster Operator that manages the Kafka cluster is running.
* The Kafka cluster deployment uses Kafka node pools.
+
If your ZooKeeper-based cluster is already using node pools, it is ready to migrate.
If not, you can xref:proc-migrating-clusters-node-pools-str[migrate the cluster to use node pools]. 
To migrate when the cluster is not using node pools, brokers must be contained in a `KafkaNodePool` resource configuration that is assigned a `broker` role and has the name `kafka`.
Support for node pools is enabled in the `Kafka` resource configuration using the `strimzi.io/node-pools: enabled` annotation.

In this procedure, the Kafka cluster name is `my-cluster`, which is located in the `my-project` namespace. 
The name of the controller node pool created is `controller`.
The node pool for the brokers is called `kafka`.

.Procedure

. For the Kafka cluster, create a node pool with a `controller` role.
+
The node pool adds a quorum of controller nodes to the cluster.

NOTE: For the migration, you cannot use a node pool of nodes that share the broker and controller roles.

. Apply the new `KafkaNodePool` resource to create the controllers.
+
Errors related to using controllers in a ZooKeeper-based environment are expected in the Cluster Operator logs.
The errors can block reconciliation.
To prevent this, perform the next step immediately.

. Enable KRaft migration in the `Kafka` resource by setting the `strimzi.io/kraft` annotation to `migration`:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl annotate kafka my-cluster strimzi.io/kraft="migration" --overwrite

    strimzi.io/kraft: migration
# ...
----
+
Applying the annotation to the `Kafka` resource configuration starts the migration.

. Check the controllers have started and the brokers have rolled:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pods -n my-project
----
+

----
+
`METADATA STATE` shows the mechanism used to manage Kafka metadata and coordinate operations.
At the start of the migration this is `ZooKeeper`.
+
--
* `ZooKeeper` is the initial state when metadata is only stored in ZooKeeper.
* `KRaftMigration` is the state when the migration is in progress.
The flag to enable ZooKeeper to KRaft migration (`zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable`) is added to the brokers and they are rolled to register with the controllers.
The migration can take some time at this point depending on the number of topics and partitions in the cluster. 
* `KRaftDualWriting` is the state when the Kafka cluster is working as a KRaft cluster, 
but metadata are being stored in both Kafka and ZooKeeper. 
Brokers are rolled a second time to remove the flag to enable migration.
* `KRaftPostMigration` is the state when KRaft mode is enabled for brokers. 
Metadata are still being stored in both Kafka and ZooKeeper. 
--
+
The migration status is also represented in the `status.kafkaMetadataState` property of the `Kafka` resource. 
+
WARNING: You can xref:proc-deploy-migrate-kraft-rollback-{context}[roll back to using ZooKeeper from this point]. 
The next step is to enable KRaft. 
Rollback cannot be performed after enabling KRaft.

. When the metadata state has reached `KRaftPostMigration`, enable KRaft in the `Kafka` resource configuration by setting the `strimzi.io/kraft` annotation to `enabled`:

my-cluster  ...  PreKRaft
my-cluster  ...  KRaft             
----
+
--
* `PreKRaft` is the state when all ZooKeeper-related resources have been automatically deleted.
* `KRaft` is the final state (after the controllers have rolled) when the KRaft migration is finalized.
--
+
NOTE: Depending on how `deleteClaim` is configured for ZooKeeper, its Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and persistent volumes (PVs) may not be deleted.
`deleteClaim` specifies whether the PVC is deleted when the cluster is uninstalled. The default is `false`.

. Remove any ZooKeeper-related configuration from the `Kafka` resource.
+
Remove the following section:
+
--
* `spec.zookeeper`
--
+
If present, you can also remove the following options from the `.spec.kafka.config` section:
+
--
* `log.message.format.version`
* `inter.broker.protocol.version`
--
+
Removing `log.message.format.version` and `inter.broker.protocol.version` causes the brokers and controllers to roll again.
Removing ZooKeeper properties removes any warning messages related to ZooKeeper configuration being present in a KRaft-operated cluster.

== Performing a rollback on the migration

Before the migration is finalized by enabling KRaft in the `Kafka` resource,  and the state has moved to the `KRaft` state, you can perform a rollback operation as follows:

. Apply the `strimzi.io/kraft="rollback"` annotation to the `Kafka` resource to roll back the brokers.
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl annotate kafka my-cluster strimzi.io/kraft="rollback" --overwrite
----

----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: my-project
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/kraft: rollback
# ...
----
+
The migration process must be in the `KRaftPostMigration` state to do this. 
The brokers are rolled back so that they can be connected to ZooKeeper again and the state returns to `KRaftDualWriting`.

. Delete the controllers node pool:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete KafkaNodePool controller -n my-project
----

. Apply the `strimzi.io/kraft="disabled"` annotation to the `Kafka` resource to return the metadata state to `ZooKeeper`.
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl annotate kafka my-cluster strimzi.io/kraft="disabled" --overwrite
----
+
