= Accessing the HTTP Bridge outside of Kubernetes

[role="_abstract"]
After deployment, the HTTP Bridge can only be accessed by applications running in the same Kubernetes cluster.
These applications use the `_<kafka_bridge_name>_-bridge-service` service to access the API.

If you want to make the HTTP Bridge accessible to applications running outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you can expose it manually by creating one of the following features:

* `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` type services

* `Ingress` resources (Kubernetes only)

* OpenShift routes (OpenShift only)

If you decide to create Services, use the labels from the `selector` of the `_<kafka_bridge_name>_-bridge-service` service to configure the pods to which the service will route the traffic:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
  # ...
  selector:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-bridge-name <1>
    strimzi.io/kind: KafkaBridge
  #...
----
<1> Name of the HTTP Bridge custom resource in your Kubernetes cluster.
