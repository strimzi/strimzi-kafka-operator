= Example configuration and deployment files

[role="_abstract"]
Use the example configuration and deployment files provided with Strimzi to deploy Kafka components with different configurations and monitor your deployment.
Example configuration files for custom resources contain important properties and values, which you can extend with additional supported configuration properties for your own deployment.

== Example files location

The example files are provided with the downloadable release artifacts from the {ReleaseDownload}.

ifdef::Downloading[]
You can also access the example files directly from the
link:https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/{GithubVersion}/examples/[`examples` directory^].
endif::Downloading[]

You can download and apply the examples using the `kubectl` command-line tool.
The examples can serve as a starting point when building your own Kafka component configuration for deployment.

NOTE: If you installed Strimzi using the Operator, you can still download the example files and use them to upload configuration.

== Example files provided with Strimzi

The release artifacts include an `examples` directory that contains the configuration examples.
