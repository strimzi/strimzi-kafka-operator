= Deploying the Topic Operator using the Cluster Operator

This procedure describes how to deploy the Topic Operator using the Cluster Operator.

You configure the `entityOperator` property of the `Kafka` resource to include the `topicOperator`.

If you want to use the Topic Operator with a Kafka cluster that is not managed by Strimzi,
you must xref:deploying-the-topic-operator-standalone-{context}[deploy the Topic Operator as a standalone component].

For more information about configuring the `entityOperator` and `topicOperator` properties,
see link:{BookURLUsing}#assembly-kafka-entity-operator-deployment-configuration-kafka[Entity Operator^] in the _Using Strimzi_ guide.

.Prerequisites

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-str[The Cluster Operator must be deployed.]

.Procedure

. Edit the `entityOperator` properties of the `Kafka` resource to include `topicOperator`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  #...
  entityOperator:
    *topicOperator: {}*
    userOperator: {}
----
. Configure the Topic Operator `spec` using the properties described in link:{BookURLUsing}#type-EntityTopicOperatorSpec-reference[`EntityTopicOperatorSpec` schema reference^].
+
Use an empty object (`{}`) if you want all properties to use their default values.
. Create or update the resource:
+
Use `kubectl apply`:
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _<your-file>_
