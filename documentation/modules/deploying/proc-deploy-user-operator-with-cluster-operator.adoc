= Deploying the User Operator using the Cluster Operator

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes how to deploy the User Operator using the Cluster Operator.

You configure the `entityOperator` property of the `Kafka` resource to include the `userOperator`.
By default, the User Operator watches for `KafkaUser` resources in the namespace of the Kafka cluster deployment.
You can also specify a namespace using `watchedNamespace` in the User Operator `spec`.
A single User Operator can watch a single namespace. 
One namespace should be watched by only one User Operator.

If you want to use the User Operator with a Kafka cluster that is not managed by Strimzi,
you must xref:deploying-the-user-operator-standalone-{context}[deploy the User Operator as a standalone component].

For more information about configuring the `entityOperator` and `userOperator` properties, see link:{BookURLConfiguring}#assembly-kafka-entity-operator-str[Configuring the Entity Operator^].

.Procedure

. Edit the `entityOperator` properties of the `Kafka` resource to include `userOperator`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  #...
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    *userOperator: {}*
----
. Configure the User Operator `spec` using the properties described in link:{BookURLConfiguring}#type-EntityUserOperatorSpec-reference[`EntityUserOperatorSpec` schema reference^].
+
Use an empty object (`{}`) if you want all properties to use their default values.

. Create or update the resource:
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _<kafka_configuration_file>_

. Check the status of the deployment:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get pods -n _<my_cluster_operator_namespace>_
----
+
.Output shows the pod name and readiness
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS
my-cluster-entity-operator  3/3     Running   0
# ...
----
+
`my-cluster` is the name of the Kafka cluster.
+
`READY` shows the number of replicas that are ready/expected.
The deployment is successful when the `STATUS` shows as `Running`.
