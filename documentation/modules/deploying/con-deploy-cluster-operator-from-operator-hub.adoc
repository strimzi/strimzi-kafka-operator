= Deploying Strimzi from OperatorHub.io

[role="_abstract"]
OperatorHub.io is a catalog of Kubernetes operators sourced from multiple providers.
It offers you an alternative way to install a stable version of Strimzi.

The {OperatorLifecycleManager} is used for the installation and management of all operators published on OperatorHub.io.
{OperatorLifecycleManager} is a prerequisite for installing the Strimzi Kafka operator

To install Strimzi, locate _Strimzi_ from {OperatorHub}, and follow the instructions provided to deploy the Cluster Operator.
After you have deployed the Cluster Operator, you can deploy Strimzi components using custom resources.
For example, you can deploy the `Kafka` custom resource, and the installed Cluster Operator will create a Kafka cluster.

WARNING:  While the Cluster Operator can be configured to watch multiple namespaces, each watched namespace should contain only one instance of a specific component type, such as one Kafka cluster, to avoid conflicts.

Upgrades between versions might include manual steps.
Always read the release notes before upgrading.

For information on upgrades, see xref:assembly-upgrade-{context}[].

WARNING: Make sure you use the appropriate update channel.
Installing Strimzi from the default _stable_ channel is generally safe.
However, we do not recommend enabling _automatic_ OLM updates on the stable channel.
An automatic upgrade will skip any necessary steps prior to upgrade.
Use automatic upgrades only on version-specific channels.
