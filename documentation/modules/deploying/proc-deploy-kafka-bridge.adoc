= Deploying Kafka Bridge to your Kubernetes cluster

This procedure shows how to deploy a Kafka Bridge cluster to your Kubernetes cluster using the Cluster Operator.

The deployment uses a YAML file to provide the specification to create a `KafkaBridge` resource.

In this procedure, we use the example file provided with Strimzi:

* `examples/bridge/kafka-bridge.yaml`

For information about configuring the `KafkaBridge` resource,
see link:{BookURLUsing}#assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-bridge-str[Kafka Bridge configuration^] in the _Using Strimzi_ guide.
