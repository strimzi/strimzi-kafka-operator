= Exposing the Kafka Bridge service to your local machine

[role="_abstract"]
Use port forwarding to expose the Strimzi Kafka Bridge service to your local machine on http://localhost:8080.

NOTE: Port forwarding is only suitable for development and testing purposes.

.Procedure

. List the names of the pods in your Kubernetes cluster:
+
[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
kubectl get pods -o name

pod/kafka-consumer
# ...
pod/my-bridge-bridge-7cbd55496b-nclrt
----

. Connect to the Kafka Bridge pod on port `8080`:
+
[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
kubectl port-forward pod/my-bridge-bridge-7cbd55496b-nclrt 8080:8080 &
----
+
NOTE: If port 8080 on your local machine is already in use, use an alternative HTTP port, such as `8008`.

API requests are now forwarded from port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the Kafka Bridge pod.
