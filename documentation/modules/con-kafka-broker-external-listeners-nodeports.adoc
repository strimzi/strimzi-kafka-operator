= Exposing Kafka using node ports

When exposing Kafka using `NodePort` type `Services`, Kafka clients connect directly to the nodes of Kubernetes.
You must enable access to the ports on the Kubernetes nodes for each client (for example, in firewalls or security groups).
Each Kafka broker pod is then accessible on a separate port.

An additional `NodePort` type of service is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address.

When configuring the advertised addresses for the Kafka broker pods, Strimzi uses the address of the node on which the given pod is running.
Nodes often have multiple addresses.
The address type used is based on the first type found in the following order of priority:

. ExternalDNS
. ExternalIP
. Hostname
. InternalDNS
. InternalIP

You can use the `preferredAddressType` property in your listener configuration to specify the first address type checked as the node address.
This property is useful, for example, if your deployment does not have DNS support, or you only want to expose a broker internally through an internal DNS or IP address.
If an address of this type is found, it is used.
If the preferred address type is not found, Strimzi proceeds through the types in the standard order of priority.

By default, TLS encryption is enabled.
To disable it, set the `tls` field to `false`.

NOTE: TLS hostname verification is not currently supported when exposing Kafka clusters using node ports.

By default, the port numbers used for the bootstrap and broker services are automatically assigned by Kubernetes.
However, you can override the assigned node ports by specifying the requested port numbers in the `overrides` property.
Strimzi does not perform any validation on the requested ports; you must ensure that they are free and available for use.

= Customizing the DNS names of external node port listeners

On `nodeport` listeners, you can use the `dnsAnnotations` property to add additional annotations to the nodeport services.
You can use these annotations to instrument DNS tooling such as {KubernetesExternalDNS}, which automatically assigns DNS names to the cluster nodes.
