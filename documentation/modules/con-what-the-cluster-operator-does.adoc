= Overview of the Cluster Operator component

{ProductName} uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage clusters for:

* Kafka (including {Zookeeper}, Entity Operator and Kafka Exporter)
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka Mirror Maker
* Kafka Bridge

Custom resources are used to deploy the clusters.

For example, to deploy a Kafka cluster:

* A `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration is created within the Kubernetes cluster.
* The Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster, based on what is declared in the `Kafka` resource.

The Cluster Operator can also deploy (through Entity Operator configuration of the `Kafka` resource):

* A Topic Operator to provide operator-style topic management through `KafkaTopic` custom resources
* A User Operator to provide operator-style user management through `KafkaUser` custom resources

For more information on the configuration options supported by the `Kafka` resource, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-str[].

NOTE: On OpenShift, a Kafka Connect deployment can incorporate a Source2Image feature to provides a convenient way to include connectors.
