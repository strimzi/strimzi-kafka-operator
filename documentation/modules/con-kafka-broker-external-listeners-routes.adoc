= Exposing Kafka using OpenShift `Routes`

When exposing Kafka using OpenShift `Routes`  and the HAProxy router, a dedicated `Route` is created for every Kafka broker pod.
An additional `Route` is created to serve as a Kafka bootstrap address.
Kafka clients can use these `Routes` to connect to Kafka on port 443.

TLS encryption is always used with `Routes`.

By default, the route hosts are automatically assigned by OpenShift.
However, you can override the assigned route hosts by specifying the requested hosts in the `overrides` property.
Strimzi will not perform any validation that the requested hosts are available; you must ensure that they are free and can be used.
