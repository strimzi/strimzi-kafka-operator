= Kafka authorization

You can configure authorization for Kafka brokers using the `authorization` property in the `Kafka.spec.kafka` resource.
If the `authorization` property is missing, no authorization is enabled and clients have no restrictions.
When enabled, authorization is applied to all enabled listeners.
The authorization method is defined in the `type` field.

Supported authorization options:

* xref:type-KafkaAuthorizationSimple-reference[Simple authorization]
* xref:assembly-oauth-authorization_str[OAuth 2.0 authorization] (if you are using OAuth 2.0 token based authentication)
* xref:type-KafkaAuthorizationOpa-reference[Open Policy Agent (OPA) authorization]

== Super users

Super users can access all resources in your Kafka cluster regardless of any access restrictions,
and are supported by all authorization mechanisms.

To designate super users for a Kafka cluster, add a list of user principals to the `superUsers` property.
If a user uses TLS client authentication, their username is the common name from their certificate subject prefixed with `CN=`.
