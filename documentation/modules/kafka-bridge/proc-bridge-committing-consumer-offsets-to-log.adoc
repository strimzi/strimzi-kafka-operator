= Commiting offsets to the log

[role="_abstract"]
Use the link:https://strimzi.io/docs/bridge/latest/#_commit[offsets^] endpoint to manually commit offsets to the log for all messages received by the Kafka Bridge consumer. This is required because the Kafka Bridge consumer that you created earlier, in xref:proc-creating-kafka-bridge-consumer-{context}[Creating a Kafka Bridge consumer], was configured with the `enable.auto.commit` setting as `false`.

.Procedure

* Commit offsets to the log for the `bridge-quickstart-consumer`:
+
[source,curl,subs=attributes+]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/consumers/bridge-quickstart-consumer-group/instances/bridge-quickstart-consumer/offsets
----
+
Because no request body is submitted, offsets are committed for all the records that have been received by the consumer. Alternatively, the request body can contain an array (link:https://strimzi.io/docs/bridge/latest/#_offsetcommitseeklist[OffsetCommitSeekList^]) that specifies the topics and partitions that you want to commit offsets for.
+
If the request is successful, the Kafka Bridge returns a `204` code only.

.What to do next

After committing offsets to the log, try out the endpoints for xref:proc-bridge-seeking-offset-for-partition-{context}[seeking to offsets].
