= Uninstalling Strimzi

This procedure describes how to uninstall Strimzi and remove resources related to the deployment.

.Prerequisites

In order to perform this procedure, identify resources created specifically for a deployment and referenced from the Strimzi resource.

Such resources include:

* Secrets (Custom CAs and certificates, Kafka Connect secrets, and other Kafka secrets)
* Logging `ConfigMaps` (of type `external`)

These are resources referenced by `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaConnectS2I`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, or `KafkaBridge` configuration.

.Procedure

. Delete the Cluster Operator `Deployment`, related `CustomResourceDefinitions`, and `RBAC` resources:
+
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
kubectl delete -f install/cluster-operator
----
+
WARNING: Deleting `CustomResourceDefinitions` results in the garbage collection of the corresponding custom resources (`Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaConnectS2I`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, or `KafkaBridge`) and the resources dependent on them (Deployments, StatefulSets, and other dependent resources).

. Delete the resources you identified in the prerequisites.
