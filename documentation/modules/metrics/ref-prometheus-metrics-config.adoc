Strimzi uses the link:https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter[Prometheus JMX Exporter^] to expose JMX metrics through an HTTP endpoint, which is then scraped by the Prometheus server.

Grafana dashboards are dependent on Prometheus JMX Exporter relabeling rules, which are defined for Strimzi components in the custom resource configuration.

A label is a name-value pair.
Relabeling is the process of writing a label dynamically.
For example, the value of a label may be derived from the name of a Kafka server and client ID.

Strimzi provides example custom resource configuration YAML files with relabeling rules.
When deploying Prometheus metrics configuration, you can can deploy the example custom resource or copy the metrics configuration to your own custom resource definition.
