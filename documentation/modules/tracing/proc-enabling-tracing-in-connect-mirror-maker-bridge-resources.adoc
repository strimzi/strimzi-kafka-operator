= Enabling tracing in supported Kafka components

[role="_abstract"]
Distributed tracing is supported for MirrorMaker, MirrorMaker 2, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka Bridge.
Enable tracing using OpenTelemetry by setting the `spec.tracing.type` property to `opentelemetry`. 
Configure the custom resource of the component to specify and enable a tracing system using `spec.template` properties.

By default, OpenTelemetry uses the OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) exporter and endpoint to gather trace data. 
This procedure shows the configuration to use OTLP as the tracing system.

If you prefer to use a different tracing system supported by OpenTelemetry, such as Jaeger, you can modify the exporter and endpoint settings in the tracing configuration.

CAUTION: Strimzi no longer supports OpenTracing.
If you were previously using OpenTracing with the `type: jaeger` option, we encourage you to transition to using OpenTelemetry instead.

Enabling tracing in a resource triggers the following events:

* Interceptor classes are updated in the integrated consumers and producers of the component.

* For MirrorMaker, MirrorMaker 2, and Kafka Connect, the tracing agent initializes a tracer based on the tracing configuration defined in the resource.

* For the Kafka Bridge, a tracer based on the tracing configuration defined in the resource is initialized by the Kafka Bridge itself.

.Tracing in MirrorMaker 2

For MirrorMaker 2, messages are traced from the source cluster to the target cluster. The trace data records messages entering and leaving the MirrorMaker 2 component.

.Tracing in Kafka Connect

For Kafka Connect, only messages produced and consumed by Kafka Connect are traced. To trace messages sent between Kafka Connect and external systems, you must configure tracing in the connectors for those systems.

.Tracing in the Kafka Bridge

For the Kafka Bridge, messages produced and consumed by the Kafka Bridge are traced. Incoming HTTP requests from client applications to send and receive messages through the Kafka Bridge are also traced.
To have end-to-end tracing, you must configure tracing in your HTTP clients.

.Procedure

Perform these steps for each `KafkaMirrorMaker2`, `KafkaConnect`, and `KafkaBridge` resource.

. In the `spec.template` property, configure the tracer service.

--
* Use the xref:ref-tracing-environment-variables-{context}[tracing environment variables] as template configuration properties.
* For OpenTelemetry, set the `spec.tracing.type` property to `opentelemetry`.

. (Optional) If TLS authentication is configured on the OTLP endpoint, use the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to specify the path to a trusted certificate
This secures communication between Kafka components and the OpenTelemetry endpoint.
+
To provide the certificate, mount a volume containing the secret that holds the trusted certificate.  
Unless the endpoint address is redirected from `http`, use `https`.
