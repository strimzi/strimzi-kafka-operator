= User authentication

[role="_abstract"]
User authentication is configured using the `authentication` property in `KafkaUser.spec`.
The authentication mechanism enabled for the user is specified using the `type` field.

Supported authentication types:

* `tls` for TLS client authentication
* `tls-external` for TLS client authentication using external certificates
* `scram-sha-512` for SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

If `tls` or `scram-sha-512` is specified, the User Operator creates authentication credentials when it creates the user.
If `tls-external` is specified, the user still uses TLS client authentication, but no authentication credentials are created.
Use this option when you're providing your own certificates.
When no authentication type is specified, the User Operator does not create the user or its credentials.

You can use `tls-external` to authenticate with TLS using a certificate issued outside the User Operator.
The User Operator does not generate a TLS certificate or a secret.
You can still manage user authorization through the User Operator in the same way as with the `tls` mechanism.
This means that you use the `CN=__USER-NAME__` format when specifying ACL rules and quotas.
_USER-NAME_ is the common name given in a TLS certificate.

== TLS client authentication

To use TLS client authentication, you set the `type` field in the `KafkaUser` resource to `tls`.

.Example user with TLS client authentication enabled
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaUserApiVersion}
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
  # ...
----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it creates a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret contains a private and public key for TLS client authentication.
The public key is contained in a user certificate, which is signed by the client Certificate Authority (CA).

All keys are in X.509 format.

Secrets provide private keys and certificates in PEM and PKCS #12 formats.

For more information on securing Kafka communication with secrets, see xref:security-{context}[].

== TLS client authentication using a certificate issued outside the User Operator

To use TLS client authentication using a certificate issued outside the User Operator, you set the `type` field in the `KafkaUser` resource to `tls-external`.
A secret and credentials are not created for the user.

== SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

To use the SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication mechanism, you set the `type` field in the `KafkaUser` resource to `scram-sha-512`.

.Example user with SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication enabled

----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it creates a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret contains the generated password in the `password` key, which is encoded with base64.
In order to use the password, it must be decoded.

=== Custom password configuration

When a user is created, Strimzi generates a random password.
You can use your own password instead of the one generated by Strimzi. To do so, create a secret with the password and reference it in the `KafkaUser` resource.
