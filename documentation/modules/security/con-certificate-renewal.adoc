= Certificate renewal and validity periods

[role="_abstract"]
Cluster CA and clients CA certificates are valid for a limited time, known as the validity period. 
This is defined as the number of days from the date the certificate was generated.

For CA certificates automatically created by the Cluster Operator, configure the validity period for certificates in the `kafka` resource:

* `Kafka.spec.clusterCa.validityDays` for Cluster CA certificates
* `Kafka.spec.clientsCa.validityDays` for Clients CA certificates

The default validity period for both certificates is 365 days.
For manually-installed CA certificates, set validity through your certificate management system.

When a CA certificate expires, components and clients that still trust the old certificate do not accept connections from peers whose certificates were signed by the CA private key.
The components and clients must trust the _new_ CA certificate instead.

To prevent loss of service, the Cluster Operator initiates certificate renewal before the old CA certificates expire.

Configure the renewal period of the certificates created by the Cluster Operator in the `kafka` resource using the following properties:

* `Kafka.spec.clusterCa.renewalDays` for Cluster CA certificates
* `Kafka.spec.clientsCa.renewalDays` for Clients CA certificates

The default renewal period for both certificates is 30 days from the expiry date of the current certificate.

To schedule the renewal period at a convenient time, use xref:con-maintenance-time-window-definition-{context}[maintenance time windows].

IMPORTANT: `maintenanceTimeWindows` apply *only* to certificates generated automatically by the Cluster Operator. 
They do *not* apply to custom or externally managed certificates. 
When using custom certificates, restarts may occur outside the defined maintenance windows.

To change validity and renewal periods after creating the Kafka cluster:

. Modify the `Kafka` custom resource.
. xref:proc-renewing-ca-certs-manually-{context}[Manually renew the CA certificates].

If you do not manually renew the certificates, the new settings take effect the next time the certificate is renewed automatically.

Automatic certificate renewal depends on the `generateCertificateAuthority` setting:

* If `true`, the Cluster Operator handles renewal.
* If `false`, certificates must be managed externally. +
Use this option if you are xref:installing-your-own-ca-certificates-{context}[installing your own certificates].

== Cluster CA renewal

To renew the Cluster CA certificate, the Cluster Operator does the following:

. Generates a new Cluster CA certificate, retaining the existing private key.
+
The renewed certificate replaces `ca.crt` in the Cluster CA secret.

. Regenerates internal client certificates for the following components:
** Kafka nodes
** Entity Operator (Topic Operator and User Operator)
** Kafka Exporter
** Cruise Control
+
These new certificates are not strictly required, because the signing key hasn't changed. 
However, the Cluster Operator regenerates them to align their validity period with the new CA certificate.

. Restarts the components to trust the new Cluster CA certificate and use the renewed internal certificates.

=== Clients CA renewal

To renew the Clients CA certificate, the Cluster Operator and User Operator each perform part of the process:

. The Cluster Operator generates a new Clients CA certificate, retaining the existing private key.
+
The renewed certificate replaces `ca.crt` in the Clients CA secret.

. The User Operator detects the updated Clients CA certificate and regenerates the user certificates that are signed by it.

IMPORTANT: After renewal, you must ensure client applications update their truststores and keystores with the renewed user certificates before the old ones expire to avoid connection failures.

== Managing certificate renewal for client applications

The Strimzi operators do not manage external client applications. 
You are responsible for ensuring that clients continue to connect successfully after certificate renewal.

When the Clients CA is renewed, the User Operator automatically regenerates user certificates. 
Client applications must be updated to use these renewed credentials before the old certificates expire.

Client applications must be configured with the following:

* A truststore that includes credentials from the `<cluster_name>-cluster-ca-cert` secret, which is created by the Cluster Operator and contains the public key to verify the Kafka cluster.
* A keystore built from the `<kafka_user_name>` secret, which is created by the User Operator and contains the user's certificate and key.

User secrets provide credentials in PEM and PKCS #12 formats, or a password if using SCRAM-SHA authentication. 
The User Operator creates these secrets when a user is created.
For an example of configuring secure clients, see xref:proc-configuring-secure-kafka-user-str[].

If you provision client certificates manually, generate and distribute new certificates before the current ones expire. 
Failure to do so can result in clients being unable to connect to the Kafka cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For workloads in the same Kubernetes cluster and namespace, you can mount secrets as volumes. 
This allows client pods to construct keystores and truststores dynamically from the current state of the secrets.
For details, see xref:configuring-internal-clients-to-trust-cluster-ca-{context}[Configuring internal clients to trust the cluster CA].
