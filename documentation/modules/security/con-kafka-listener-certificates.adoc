= Kafka listener certificates

You can provide your own server certificates and private keys for the following types of listeners:

* TLS listeners for inter-cluster communication

* External listeners (`route`, `loadbalancer`, `ingress`, and `nodeport` types) which have TLS encryption enabled, for communication between Kafka clients and Kafka brokers

These user-provided certificates are called _Kafka listener certificates_.

Providing Kafka listener certificates for external listeners allows you to leverage existing security infrastructure, such as your organization's private CA or a public CA.
Kafka clients will connect to Kafka brokers using Kafka listener certificates rather than certificates signed by the cluster CA or clients CA.

You must manually renew Kafka listener certificates when needed.
