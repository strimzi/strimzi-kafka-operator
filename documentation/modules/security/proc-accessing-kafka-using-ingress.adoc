= Accessing Kafka using ingresses

[role="_abstract"]
Use an {NginxIngressController} to access a Strimzi Kafka cluster from clients outside the Kubernetes cluster. 
The Nginx Ingress Controller supports connections from HTTP and HTTPS-based applications.

To be able to use an Nginx Ingress Controller, add configuration for an `ingress` type listener in the `Kafka` custom resource. 
When applied, the configuration creates a dedicated ingress and service for an external bootstrap and each broker in the cluster. 
Clients connect to the bootstrap ingress, which routes them through the bootstrap service to connect to a broker. 
Per-broker connections are then established using DNS names, which route traffic from the client to the broker through the broker-specific ingresses and services.

To connect to a broker, you specify a hostname (advertised address) for the ingress bootstrap address, as well as the certificate used for authentication.

For access using an ingress, the port is always 443.

.TLS passthrough

Make sure that you enable TLS passthrough in your NGINX Ingress Controller deployment.
Kafka uses a binary protocol over TCP, but the NGINX Ingress Controller is designed to work with a HTTP protocol. 
To be able to route traffic through ingresses, Strimzi uses TLS passthrough with Server Name Indication (SNI).

SNI helps with identifying and passing connection to Kafka brokers.
In passthrough mode, TLS encryption is always used.
Because connection passes to the brokers, the listeners use the TLS certificates signed by the internal cluster CA.
To configure listeners to use your own listener certificates, xref:proc-installing-certs-per-listener-{context}[use the `brokerCertChainAndKey` property]. 

For more information about enabling TLS passthrough, see the {NginxIngressControllerTLSPassthrough}.

.Prerequisites

* An NGINX Ingress Controller is running with TLS passthrough enabled
* A running Cluster Operator

In this procedure, the Kafka cluster name is `my-cluster`.

NOTE: You can install and use the NGINX Ingress Operator to deploy an NGINX Ingress Controller.

.Procedure

. Configure a `Kafka` resource with an external listener set to the `ingress` type.
+
Specify an ingress hostname for the bootstrap service and each of the Kafka brokers in the Kafka cluster.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-cluster
  name: my-cluster
  namespace: myproject
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    listeners:
      - name: external
        port: 9094
        type: ingress
        tls: true
        authentication:
          type: tls
        configuration:
          bootstrap:
            host: bootstrap.myingress.com
          brokers:
          - broker: 0
            host: broker-0.myingress.com
          - broker: 1
            host: broker-1.myingress.com
          - broker: 2
            host: broker-2.myingress.com
          class: nginx  
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
----
+
Add any hostname to the `bootstrap` and `broker-<index>` prefixes that identify the bootstrap and brokers.
+
NOTE: You might need to add `nginx` as the class if it is missing in the ingresses created. 

. Create or update the resource.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl apply -f _<kafka_configuration_file>_
----
+
A cluster CA certificate to verify the identity of the kafka brokers is created in the secret `my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert`.
+
`ClusterIP` type services are created for each Kafka broker, as well as an external bootstrap service.
+
An `ingress` is also created for each service, with a DNS address to expose them using the NGINX Ingress Controller.
+
.Ingresses created for the bootstrap and brokers
[source,shell]
----
NAME                        CLASS  HOSTS                    ADDRESS               PORTS
my-cluster-kafka-0          nginx  broker-0.myingress.com   external.ingress.com  80,443
my-cluster-kafka-1          nginx  broker-1.myingress.com   external.ingress.com  80,443
my-cluster-kafka-2          nginx  broker-2.myingress.com   external.ingress.com  80,443
my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap  nginx  bootstrap.myingress.com  external.ingress.com  80,443
----
+
The DNS addresses used for client connection are propagated to the `status` of each ingress.
+
.Status for the bootstrap ingress
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
      - hostname: external.ingress.com
 # ...
----

. Use a target broker to check the client-server TLS connection on port 443 using the OpenSSL `s_client`.  
+
[source,shell]
----
openssl s_client -connect my-cluster-kafka-0:443 -servername my-cluster-kafka-0 -showcerts
----
+
The server name is the SNI for passing the connection to the broker. 
+
If the connection is successful, the certificates for the broker are returned.
+
.Certificates for the broker
[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
Certificate chain
 0 s:O = io.strimzi, CN = my-cluster-kafka
   i:O = io.strimzi, CN = cluster-ca v0
----

. Extract the cluster CA certificate.
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl get secret my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt


. Configure your client to connect to the brokers.

.. Specify the bootstrap host (from the listener `configuration`) and port 443 in your Kafka client as the bootstrap address to connect to the Kafka cluster. For example, `bootstrap.myingress.com:443`.

.. Add the extracted certificate to the truststore of your Kafka client to configure a TLS connection.
+
If you enabled any authentication, you will also need to configure it in your client.

NOTE: If you are using your own listener certificates, check whether you need to add the CA certificate to the client's truststore configuration. 
If it is a public (external) CA, you usually won't need to add it.
