= Defining ACL rules

The `simple` authorization mechanism uses ACL rules to manage access to Kafka brokers.
Enabling `simple` authorization for a Kafka cluster means access is denied unless explicit ACL rules are configured in the `KafkaUser` resource.
ACL rules define access rights for users, which you specify using the `acls` property.

<1> Defines the Kafka resource type to which the ACL rules apply, such as `topic` or `group`, the name of the resource, and how the name is matched by `patternType`.
<2> Specifies the operations, such as `Describe`, `Read`, that the user is allowed to perform on the resource.
