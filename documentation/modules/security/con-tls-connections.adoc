= TLS connections

== ZooKeeper communication

Communication between the ZooKeeper nodes on all ports as well as between clients and ZooKeeper is encrypted.

== Kafka interbroker communication

Communication between Kafka brokers is done through an internal listener on port 9091, which is encrypted by default and not accessible to Kafka clients.

Communication between Kafka brokers and ZooKeeper nodes is also encrypted.

== Topic and User Operators

All Operators use encryption for communication with both Kafka and ZooKeeper.
In Topic and User Operators, a TLS sidecar is used when communicating with ZooKeeper.

== Cruise Control

Cruise Control uses encryption for communication with both Kafka and ZooKeeper.
A TLS sidecar is used when communicating with ZooKeeper.

== Kafka Client connections

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients running within the same Kubernetes cluster can be provided by configuring the `spec.kafka.listeners.tls` listener, which listens on port 9093.

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients running outside the same Kubernetes cluster can be provided by configuring the `spec.kafka.listeners.external` listener (the port of the `external` listener depends on its type).

NOTE: Unencrypted client communication with brokers can be configured by `spec.kafka.listeners.plain`, which listens on port 9092.
