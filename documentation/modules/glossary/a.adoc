[id="glossary-access-operator_{context}"]
== Access Operator
An optional operator that simplifies the sharing of Kafka connection information and credentials between namespaces. 
Connection details are stored centrally in a `Secret` resource.

[id="glossary-authentication_{context}"]
== Authentication 
Defines how clients prove their identity to the Kafka cluster. 
Strimzi manages authentication as a client-server relationship:

* *Server-Side*: The Kafka cluster's listeners are configured to require a specific authentication type.
* *Client-Side*: A client (a `KafkaUser` or a client-based Kafka component managed by Strimzi) must be configured to provide matching credentials.

Listener authentication (Server-Side):: 
Listener authentication is configured per listener in the `spec.kafka.listeners` array of the `Kafka` custom resource. 
Supported types include `tls`, `scram-sha-512`, and `custom`.

Client authentication (Kafka user)::
For Kafka users, authentication is managed using the `KafkaUser` custom resource. Supported types are `tls`, `tls-external` (using an external CA), and `scram-sha-512`. 
Strimzi automatically creates the necessary `Secret` resources for the user.

Client authentication (Kafka components)::
For Strimzi-managed components, authentication is managed in the custom resource of the component, such as `KafkaConnect`.
Supported types include `tls`, `scram-sha-256`, `scram-sha-512`, `plain`, and `custom`.

[id="glossary-authorization_{context}"]
== Authorization (cluster-wide)
Defines which actions an authenticated client is permitted to perform on Kafka resources, such as writing to or reading from a topic. 
Configuration involves setting a cluster-wide mechanism and then, if required, defining user-specific rules.

Cluster-wide authorization::
This defines the overall mechanism used by the Kafka cluster to control client actions. 
It's configured in the `spec.kafka.authorization` section of the `Kafka` custom resource. 
Supported types include `simple` (using the Kafka's built-in authorizer) and `custom` (using custom authorizers).

User authorization (ACLs)::
This defines specific Access Control Lists (ACLs) for a user, granting permissions to perform actions on `Kafka` resources. 
The ACLs are defined in the `spec.authorization` section of the `KafkaUser` custom resource.
If using a custom authorization mechanism, user permissions are typically managed within the external authorization system and not through the `KafkaUser` resource.
