== Upgrade
[id="glossary-upgrade_{context}"]
The process of updating the Cluster Operator and the Kafka cluster it manages. 
Upgrade typically involves upgrading the operator first, then the Kafka version, and finally the metadata version.

Upgrade paths:

incremental upgrade:: Move between consecutive minor versions  
multi-version upgrade:: Skip one or more minor versions

For more information, see {BookURLDeploying}#assembly-upgrade-str[Upgrading Strimzi^].
