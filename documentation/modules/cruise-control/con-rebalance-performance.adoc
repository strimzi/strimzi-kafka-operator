= Rebalance performance tuning overview 

You can adjust several performance tuning options for cluster rebalances. 
These options control how partition replica and leadership movements in a rebalance are executed, as well as the bandwidth that is allocated to a rebalance operation.

== Partition reassignment commands

xref:con-optimization-proposals-{context}[Optimization proposals] are comprised of separate partition reassignment commands. 
When you xref:proc-approving-optimization-proposal-{context}[approve] a proposal, the Cruise Control server applies these commands to the Kafka cluster.

A partition reassignment command consists of either of the following types of operations:

* Partition movement: Involves transferring the partition replica and its data to a new location. Partition movements can take one of two forms:
    ** Inter-broker movement: The partition replica is moved to a log directory on a different broker.
    ** Intra-broker movement: The partition replica is moved to a different log directory on the same broker.

* Leadership movement: This involves switching the leader of the partition's replicas.

Cruise Control issues partition reassignment commands to the Kafka cluster in batches.
The performance of the cluster during the rebalance is affected by the number of each type of movement contained in each batch.

== Replica movement strategies

Cluster rebalance performance is also influenced by the _replica movement strategy_ that is applied to the batches of partition reassignment commands. 
By default, Cruise Control uses the `BaseReplicaMovementStrategy`, which simply applies the commands in the order they were generated.
However, if there are some very large partition reassignments early in the proposal, this strategy can slow down the application of the other reassignments.

Cruise Control provides three alternative replica movement strategies that can be applied to optimization proposals:

* `PrioritizeSmallReplicaMovementStrategy`: Order reassignments in order of ascending size.
* `PrioritizeLargeReplicaMovementStrategy`: Order reassignments in order of descending size. 
* `PostponeUrpReplicaMovementStrategy`: Prioritize reassignments for replicas of partitions which have no out-of-sync replicas.

These strategies can be configured as a sequence.
The first strategy attempts to compare two partition reassignments using its internal logic. 
If the reassignments are equivalent, then it passes them to the next strategy in the sequence to decide the order, and so on.

== Rebalance tuning options

Cruise Control provides several configuration options for tuning the rebalance parameters discussed above.
You can set these tuning options at either the xref:ref-cruise-control-configuration-{context}[Cruise Control server] or xref:proc-generating-optimization-proposals-{context}[optimization proposal] levels:

* The Cruise Control server setting can be set in the Kafka custom resource under `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`. 
* The individual rebalance performance configurations can be set under `KafkaRebalance.spec`. 

The relevant configurations are summarized below:

|============================================================================================================================
| Server and `KafkaRebalance` Configuration                | Description                                          | Default Value

| `num.concurrent.partition.movements.per.broker`   .2+| 
  The maximum number of inter-broker partition movements in each partition reassignment batch              .2+| 5 
| `concurrentPartitionMovementsPerBroker` 

| `num.concurrent.intra.broker.partition.movements` .2+| 
  The maximum number of intra-broker partition movements in each partition reassignment batch              .2+| 2
| `concurrentIntraBrokerPartitionMovements`

| `num.concurrent.leader.movements`                 .2+| 
  The maximum number of partition leadership changes in each partition reassignment batch                  .2+| 1000        
| `concurrentLeaderMovements`              

| `default.replication.throttle`                    .2+|
  The bandwidth (in bytes per second) to be assigned to the reassigning of partitions                      .2+| No Limit    
| `replicationThrottle`

| `default.replica.movement.strategies`             .2+| 
  The list of strategies (in priority order) used to determine the order in which partition reassignment commands are executed for generated proposals. Use a comma separated string for server and a YAML array for `KafkaRebalance` resources.
.2+| `BaseReplicaMovementStrategy`
| `replicaMovementStrategies`

|============================================================================================================================

Changing the default settings affects the length of time that the rebalance takes to complete, as well as the load placed on the Kafka cluster during the rebalance. 
Using lower values reduces the load but increases the amount of time taken, and vice versa.
