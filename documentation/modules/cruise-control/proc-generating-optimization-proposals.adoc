= Generating optimization proposals

[role="_abstract"]
When you create or update a `KafkaRebalance` resource, Cruise Control generates an xref:con-optimization-proposals-{context}[optimization proposal] for the Kafka cluster based on the configured xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals].
Analyze the information in the optimization proposal and decide whether to approve it.
You can use the results of the optimization proposal to rebalance your Kafka cluster.

You can run the optimization proposal in one of the following modes:

* `full` (default)
* `add-brokers`
* `remove-brokers`

The mode you use depends on whether you are rebalancing across all the brokers already running in the Kafka cluster;
or you want to rebalance after scaling up or before scaling down your Kafka cluster.
For more information, see xref:con-optimization-proposals-modes-{context}[Rebalancing modes with broker scaling].

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:proc-configuring-deploying-cruise-control-{context}[deployed Cruise Control] to your Strimzi cluster.
* You have configured xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals] and, optionally, xref:property-cruise-control-broker-capacity-reference[capacity limits on broker resources].

.Procedure

. Create a `KafkaRebalance` resource and specify the appropriate mode.
+
`full` mode (default)::
+
--
To use the _default optimization goals_ defined in the `Kafka` resource, leave the `spec` property empty.
Cruise Control rebalances a Kafka cluster in `full` mode by default.

.Example configuration with full rebalancing by default
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec: {}
----

You can also run a full rebalance by specifying the `full` mode through the `spec.mode` property.

.Example configuration specifying `full` mode
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  mode: full
----
--
`add-brokers` mode::
+
--
If you want to rebalance a Kafka cluster after scaling up, specify the `add-brokers` mode.

In this mode, existing replicas are moved to the newly added brokers.
You need to specify the brokers as a list.

.Example configuration specifying `add-brokers` mode
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  mode: add-brokers
  brokers: [3, 4] <1>
----
<1> List of newly added brokers added by the scale up operation. This property is mandatory.
--

`remove-brokers` mode::
+
--
If you want to rebalance a Kafka cluster before scaling down, specify the `remove-brokers` mode.

In this mode, replicas are moved off the brokers that are going to be removed.
You need to specify the brokers that are being removed as a list.

.Example configuration specifying `remove-brokers` mode
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  mode: remove-brokers
  brokers: [3, 4] <1>
----
<1> List of brokers to be removed by the scale down operation. This property is mandatory.
--
+
NOTE: The following steps and the steps to approve or stop a rebalance are the same regardless of the rebalance mode you are using.

. To configure _user-provided optimization goals_ instead of using the default goals, add the `goals` property and enter one or more goals.
+
In the following example, rack awareness and replica capacity are configured as user-provided optimization goals:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
----

. To ignore the configured hard goals, add the `skipHardGoalCheck: true` property:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
  skipHardGoalCheck: true
----

. (Optional) To approve the optimization proposal automatically, set the `strimzi.io/rebalance-auto-approval` annotation to `true`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/rebalance-auto-approval: "true"
spec:
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
  skipHardGoalCheck: true
----

. Create or update the resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl apply -f _<kafka_rebalance_configuration_file>_
----
+
The Cluster Operator requests the optimization proposal from Cruise Control.
This might take a few minutes depending on the size of the Kafka cluster.

. If you used the automatic approval mechanism, wait for the status of the optimization proposal to change to `Ready`.
If you haven't enabled the automatic approval mechanism, wait for the status of the optimization proposal to change to `ProposalReady`:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get kafkarebalance -o wide -w -n _<namespace>_
----
+
--
`PendingProposal`:: A `PendingProposal` status means the rebalance operator is polling the Cruise Control API to check if the optimization proposal is ready.
`ProposalReady`:: A `ProposalReady` status means the optimization proposal is ready for review and approval.
--
+
When the status changes to `ProposalReady`, the optimization proposal is ready to approve.

. Review the optimization proposal.
+
The optimization proposal is contained in the `Status.Optimization Result` property of the `KafkaRebalance` resource.

The properties in the `Optimization Result` section describe the pending cluster rebalance operation.

.Insufficient CPU capacity

If a Kafka cluster is overloaded in terms of CPU utilization, you might see an insufficient CPU capacity error in the `KafkaRebalance` status.
It's worth noting that this utilization value is unaffected by the `excludedTopics` configuration.
Although optimization proposals will not reassign replicas of excluded topics, their load is still considered in the utilization calculation.

.Example CPU utilization error
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.exception.OptimizationFailureException:
        [CpuCapacityGoal] Insufficient capacity for cpu (Utilization 615.21,
        Allowed Capacity 420.00, Threshold: 0.70). Add at least 3 brokers with
        the same cpu capacity (100.00) as broker-0. Add at least 3 brokers with
        the same cpu capacity (100.00) as broker-0.
----

[NOTE]
====
The error shows CPU capacity as a percentage rather than the number of CPU cores. 
For this reason, it does not directly map to the number of CPUs configured in the Kafka custom resource.
It is like having a single _virtual_ CPU per broker, which has the cycles of the CPUs configured in `Kafka.spec.kafka.resources.limits.cpu`.
This has no effect on the rebalance behavior, since the ratio between CPU utilization and capacity remains the same.
