= Generating optimization proposals 

When you create or update a `KafkaRebalance` resource, Cruise Control generates an xref:con-optimization-proposals-{context}[optimization proposal] for the Kafka cluster based on the configured xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals].

Analyze the information in the optimization proposal and decide whether to approve it. 

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:proc-deploying-cruise-control-{context}[deployed Cruise Control] to your Strimzi cluster.

* You have configured xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals] and, optionally, xref:capacity-configuration[capacity limits on broker resources].

.Procedure

. Create a `KafkaRebalance` resource:

.. To use the _default optimization goals_ defined in the `Kafka` resource, leave the `spec` property empty:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels: 
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec: {}
----

.. To configure _user-provided optimization goals_ instead of using the default goals, add the `goals` property and enter one or more goals.
+
In the following example, rack awareness and replica capacity are configured as user-provided optimization goals:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels: 
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:    
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
----

.. To ignore the configured hard goals, add the `skipHardGoalCheck: true` property:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels: 
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:    
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
  skipHardGoalCheck: true
----

. Create or update the resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl apply -f _your-file_
----
+
The Cluster Operator requests the optimization proposal from Cruise Control.
This might take a few minutes depending on the size of the Kafka cluster. 

. Check the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_
----
+
Cruise Control returns one of two statuses:

** `PendingProposal`: The rebalance operator is polling the Cruise Control API to check if the optimization proposal is ready.

** `ProposalReady`: The optimization proposal is ready for review and, if desired, approval.
The optimization proposal is contained in the `Status.Optimization Result` property of the `KafkaRebalance` resource.

. Review the optimization proposal.
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]

kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_

The properties in the `Optimization Result` section describe the pending cluster rebalance operation. 
For descriptions of each property, see xref:contents-optimization-proposals[Contents of optimization proposals].

.Insufficient CPU capacity

If a Kafka cluster is overloaded in terms of CPU utilization, you might see an insufficient CPU capacity error in the `KafkaRebalance` status. This might be because of excluded topics configuration (`excludedTopics`). Optimization proposals ignore excluded topics, but CPU utilization calculations consider their replicas.

.Example CPU utilization error
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.exception.OptimizationFailureException:
        [CpuCapacityGoal] Insufficient capacity for cpu (Utilization 615.21,
        Allowed Capacity 420.00, Threshold: 0.70). Add at least 3 brokers with
        the same cpu capacity (100.00) as broker-0. Add at least 3 brokers with
        the same cpu capacity (100.00) as broker-0.
----

[NOTE]
====
The error shows CPU capacity as a percentage rather than CPU cores. For that reason, it does not directly map to the number of CPUs configured in `Kafka.spec.kafka.resources`. It is like having a single _virtual_ CPU per broker, which has the cycles of one or more CPUs. This has no effect on the rebalance behavior, since the ratio between CPU utilization and capacity remains the same.
