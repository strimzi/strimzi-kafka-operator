= Cruise Control components and features

[role="_abstract"]
Cruise Control comprises four main components: 

Load Monitor:: Load Monitor collects the metrics and analyzes cluster workload data.
Analyzer:: Analyzer generates optimization proposals based on collected data and configured goals.
Anomaly Detector:: Anomaly Detector identifies and reports irregularities in cluster behavior.
Executor:: Executor applies approved optimization proposals to the cluster.
REST API:: Cruise Control provides a REST API for client interactions, which Strimzi uses to support these features:
+
* Generating optimization proposals from optimization goals
* Rebalancing a Kafka cluster based on an optimization proposal
* Changing topic replication factor
* Reassigning partitions between JBOD disks

NOTE: Other Cruise Control features are not currently supported, including self healing, notifications, and write-your-own goals.

== Optimization goals

Optimization goals define objectives for rebalancing, such as distributing topic replicas evenly across brokers. 

They are categorized as follows:

* *Supported goals* are a list of goals supported by the Cruise Control instance that can be used in its operations. 
By default, this list includes all goals included with Cruise Control. 
For a goal to be used in other categories, such as default or hard goals, it must first be listed in supported goals. 
To prevent a goal’s usage, remove it from this list.
* *Hard goals* are preset and must be satisfied for a proposal to succeed.
* *Soft goals* are preset goals with objectives that are prioritized during optimization as much as possible, without preventing a proposal from being created if all hard goals are satisfied.

* *Default goals* refer to the goals used by default when generating proposals. 
They match the supported goals unless specifically set by the user.
* *Proposal-specific goals* are a subset of supported goals configured for specific proposals.

Configure optimization goals in the `Kafka` and `KafkaRebalance` custom resources.

* `Kafka` resource for supported, hard, and default goals.
** Supported goals: `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.goals`
** Hard goals: `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.hard.goals`
** Default goals: `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.default.goals`
* `KafkaRebalance` resource for proposal-specific goals.
** Proposal-specific goals: `KafkaRebalance.spec.goals`

=== Supported goals

Supported goals are predefined and available to use for generating Cruise Control optimization proposals. 
Goals not listed as supported goals cannot be used in Cruise Control operations.
Some supported goals are preset as hard goals.

Configure supported goals in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.goals`:

* To accept inherited supported goals, omit the `goals` property.
* To modify supported goals, specify the goals in descending priority order in the `goals` property.

=== Hard and soft goals

Hard goals must be satisfied for optimization proposals to be generated. 
Soft goals are best-effort objectives that Cruise Control tries to meet after all hard goals are satisfied.
The classification of hard and soft goals is fixed in Cruise Control code and cannot be changed.

Cruise Control first prioritizes satisfying hard goals, and then addresses soft goals in the order they are listed.
A proposal meeting all hard goals is valid, even if it violates some soft goals. 

For example, a soft goal might be to evenly distribute a topic's replicas. 
Cruise Control continues to generate an optimization proposal even if the soft goal isn't completely satisfied.

Configure hard goals in your Cruise Control deployment using `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.hard.goals`:

* To enforce all hard goals, omit the `hard.goals` property.
* To specify hard goals, list them in `hard.goals`.
* To exclude a hard goal, ensure it's not in either `default.goals` or `hard.goals`.

Increasing the number of configured hard goals will reduce the likelihood of Cruise Control generating optimization proposals.

=== Default goals

Cruise Control uses default goals to generate an optimization proposal. 

If `default.goals` is not specified in the Cruise Control deployment configuration, Strimzi configures `default.goals` to the list of supported goals specified in `goals`. 

The optimization proposal based on this supported goals list is then generated and cached.

Configure default goals in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config.default.goals`:

* To use supported goals as default, omit the `default.goals` property.
* To modify default goals, specify a subset of supported goals in the `default.goals` property. +
You can adjust the priority order in the default goals configuration.

=== Proposal-specific goals

Proposal-specific optimization goals support the creation of optimization proposals based on a specific list of goals.
If proposal-specific goals are not set in the `KafkaRebalance` resource, then default goals are used

Configure proposal-specific goals in `KafkaRebalance.spec.goals`, specifying a subset of supported optimization goals for customization.

For example, you can optimize topic leader replica distribution across the Kafka cluster without considering disk capacity or utilization by defining a single proposal-specific goal.

=== Goals order of priority

Unless you change the Cruise Control xref:proc-configuring-deploying-cruise-control-{context}[deployment configuration], Strimzi inherits goals from Cruise Control, in descending priority order.

The following list shows supported goals inherited by Strimzi from Cruise Control in descending priority order.
Goals labeled as hard are mandatory constraints that must be satisfied for optimization proposals.

* `RackAwareGoal` (hard)
* `MinTopicLeadersPerBrokerGoal` (hard)
* `ReplicaCapacityGoal` (hard)
* `DiskCapacityGoal` (hard)
* `NetworkInboundCapacityGoal` (hard)
* `NetworkOutboundCapacityGoal` (hard)
* `CpuCapacityGoal` (hard)
* `ReplicaDistributionGoal`
* `PotentialNwOutGoal`
* `DiskUsageDistributionGoal`
* `NetworkInboundUsageDistributionGoal`
* `NetworkOutboundUsageDistributionGoal`
* `CpuUsageDistributionGoal`
* `TopicReplicaDistributionGoal`
* `LeaderReplicaDistributionGoal`
* `LeaderBytesInDistributionGoal`
* `PreferredLeaderElectionGoal`
* `IntraBrokerDiskCapacityGoal` (hard)
* `IntraBrokerDiskUsageDistributionGoal`

Resource distribution goals are subject to link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-cruise-control-broker-capacity-reference[capacity limits^] on broker resources.

For more information on each optimization goal, see link:https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control/wiki/Pluggable-Components#goals[Goals^] in the Cruise Control Wiki.

NOTE: "Write your own" goals and Kafka assigner goals are not supported.

----

IMPORTANT: Ensure that the supported `goals`, `default.goals`, and (unless `skipHardGoalCheck` is set to `true`) proposal-specific `spec.goals` include all hard goals specified in `hard.goals` to avoid errors when generating optimization proposals. 
Hard goals must be included as a subset in the supported, default, and proposal-specific goals.

----

=== Skipping hard goal checks

If `skipHardGoalCheck: true` is specified in the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource, Cruise Control does not verify that the proposal-specific goals include all the configured hard goals. 
This allows for more flexibility in generating optimization proposals, but may lead to proposals that do not satisfy all hard goals.

However, any hard goals included in the proposal-specific goals will still be treated as hard goals by Cruise Control, even with `skipHardGoalCheck: true`.

[id='con-optimization-proposals-{context}']
== Optimization proposals

Optimization proposals are summaries of proposed changes based on the defined optimization goals, assessed in a specific order of priority. 
You can approve or reject proposals and rerun them with adjusted goals if needed.

With Cruise Control deployed for use in Strimzi, the process to generate and approve an optimization proposal is as follows:

. Create a `KafkaRebalance` resource specifying optimization goals and any specific configurations. 
This resource triggers Cruise Control to initiate the optimization proposal generation process.
. A Cruise Control Metrics Reporter runs in every Kafka broker, collecting raw metrics and publishing them to a dedicated Kafka topic (`strimzi.cruisecontrol.metrics`).
Metrics for brokers, topics, and partitions are aggregated, sampled, and stored in other xref:proc-cruise-control-auto-created-topics-{context}[topics automatically created when Cruise Control is deployed]. 
. Load Monitor collects, processes, and stores the metrics as a _workload model_--including CPU, disk, and network utilization data--which is used by the Analyzer and Anomaly Detector.
. Anomaly Detector continuously monitors the health and performance of the Kafka cluster, checking for things like broker failures or disk capacity issues, that could impact cluster stability.
. Analyzer creates optimization proposals based on the workload model from the Load Monitor. 
Based on configured goals and capacities, it generates an optimization proposal for balancing partitions across brokers.
Through the REST API, a summary of the proposal is reflected in the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource.
. The optimization proposal is approved or rejected (manually or automatically) based on its alignment with cluster management goals.
. If approved, the Executor applies the optimization proposal to rebalance the Kafka cluster. 
This involves reassigning partitions and redistributing workload across brokers according to the approved proposal.

.Cruise Control optimization process
image:kafka-concepts-cruise-control.png[Cruise Control process]

Optimization proposals comprise a list of partition reassignment mappings.
When you approve a proposal, the Cruise Control server applies these partition reassignments to the Kafka cluster.

A partition reassignment consists of either of the following types of operations:

* Partition movement: Involves transferring the partition replica and its data to a new location. Partition movements can take one of two forms:
** Inter-broker movement: The partition replica is moved to a log directory on a different broker.
** Intra-broker movement: The partition replica is moved to a different log directory on the same broker.

* Leadership movement: Involves switching the leader of the partition's replicas.

Cruise Control issues partition reassignments to the Kafka cluster in batches.
The performance of the cluster during the rebalance is affected by the number and magnitude of each type of movement contained in each batch.

[id='con-optimization-proposals-modes-{context}']
=== Rebalancing modes

Proposals for rebalances can be generated in four modes, which are specified using the `spec.mode` property of the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.

`full` mode:: The `full` mode runs a full rebalance by moving replicas across all the brokers in the cluster.
This is the default mode if the `spec.mode` property is not defined in the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.

`add-brokers` mode:: The `add-brokers` mode is used after scaling up a Kafka cluster by adding one or more brokers.
Normally, after scaling up a Kafka cluster, new brokers are used to host only the partitions of newly created topics.
If no new topics are created, the newly added brokers are not used and the existing brokers remain under the same load.
By using the `add-brokers` mode immediately after adding brokers to the cluster, the rebalancing operation moves replicas from existing brokers to the newly added brokers.
You specify the new brokers as a list using the `spec.brokers` property of the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.

`remove-brokers` mode:: The `remove-brokers` mode is used before scaling down a Kafka cluster by removing one or more brokers.
The `remove-brokers` mode moves replicas off the brokers that are going to be removed.
When these brokers are not hosting replicas anymore, you can safely run the scaling down operation.
You specify the brokers you're removing as a list in the `spec.brokers` property in the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.

`remove-disks` mode:: The `remove-disks` mode is used specifically to reassign partitions between JBOD disks used for storage on the same broker.
You specify a list of broker IDs with corresponding volume IDs for partition reassignment. 

NOTE: Brokers are shut down even if they host replicas when xref:con-skipping-scale-down-checks-{context}[checks are skipped on scale-down operations].

In general, use the `full` rebalance mode to rebalance a Kafka cluster by spreading the load across brokers.
Use the `add-brokers` and `remove-brokers` modes only if you want to scale your cluster up or down and rebalance the replicas accordingly.

The procedure to run a rebalance is actually the same across the three different modes.
The only difference is with specifying a mode through the `spec.mode` property and, if needed, listing brokers that have been added or will be removed through the `spec.brokers` property.


[[contents-optimization-proposals]]
=== The results of an optimization proposal

When an optimization proposal is generated, a summary and broker load is returned.

Summary:: The summary is contained in the `KafkaRebalance` resource. The summary provides an overview of the proposed cluster rebalance and indicates the scale of the changes involved.
A summary of a successfully generated optimization proposal is contained in the `Status.optimizationResult` property of the `KafkaRebalance` resource.
The information provided is a summary of the full optimization proposal.
Broker load:: The broker load is stored in a ConfigMap that contains data as a JSON string. The broker load shows before and after values for the proposed rebalance, so you can see the impact on each of the brokers in the cluster.

=== Manually approving or rejecting an optimization proposal

An optimization proposal summary shows the proposed scope of changes.

You can use the name of the `KafkaRebalance` resource to return a summary from the command line.

.Returning an optimization proposal summary
[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance <kafka_rebalance_resource_name> -n <namespace>
----

You can also use the `jq` {JQTool}.

.Returning an optimization proposal result using jq
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get kafkarebalance <kafka_rebalance_resource_name> -n <namespace> -o json | jq '.status.optimizationResult'
----

Use the summary to decide whether to approve or reject an optimization proposal.

Approving an optimization proposal:: You xref:proc-approving-optimization-proposal-{context}[approve the optimization] proposal by setting the `strimzi.io/rebalance` annotation of the `KafkaRebalance` resource to `approve`.
Cruise Control applies the proposal to the Kafka cluster and starts a cluster rebalance operation.
Rejecting an optimization proposal:: If you choose not to approve an optimization proposal,
you can xref:proc-generating-optimization-proposals-str[change the optimization goals] or xref:con-rebalance-{context}[update any of the rebalance performance tuning options], and then generate another proposal.
You can generate a new optimization proposal for a `KafkaRebalance` resource by setting the `strimzi.io/rebalance` annotation to `refresh`.

Use optimization proposals to assess the movements required for a rebalance.
For example, a summary describes inter-broker and intra-broker movements.
Inter-broker rebalancing moves data between separate brokers.
Intra-broker rebalancing moves data between disks on the same broker when you are using a JBOD storage configuration.
Such information can be useful even if you don't go ahead and approve the proposal.

You might reject an optimization proposal, or delay its approval, because of the additional load on a Kafka cluster when rebalancing.
If the proposal is delayed for too long, the cluster load may change significantly, so it may be better to request a new proposal.

In the following example, the proposal suggests the rebalancing of data between separate brokers.
The rebalance involves the movement of 55 partition replicas, totaling 12MB of data, across the brokers.
The proposal will also move 24 partition leaders to different brokers.
This requires a change to the cluster metadata, which has a low impact on performance.

The balancedness scores are measurements of the overall balance of the Kafka cluster before and after the optimization proposal is approved.
A balancedness score is based on optimization goals.
If all goals are satisfied, the score is 100.
The score is reduced for each goal that will not be met.
Compare the balancedness scores to see whether the Kafka cluster is less balanced than it could be following a rebalance.

----

Though the inter-broker movement of partition replicas has a high impact on performance, the total amount of data is not large.
If the total data was much larger, you could reject the proposal, or time when to approve the rebalance to limit the impact on the performance of the Kafka cluster.

xref:con-rebalance-{context}[Rebalance performance tuning options] can help reduce the impact of data movement.
If you can extend the rebalance period, you can divide the rebalance into smaller batches.
Fewer data movements at a single time reduces the load on the cluster.

=== Optimization proposal summary properties

The following table explains the properties contained in the optimization proposal's summary.

.Properties contained in an optimization proposal summary
[cols="1m,1",options="header"]
|===
| JSON property
| Description

| numIntraBrokerReplicaMovements
| The total number of partition replicas that will be transferred between the disks of the cluster's brokers.

*Performance impact during rebalance operation*: Relatively high, but lower than `numReplicaMovements`.

| excludedBrokersForLeadership
| Not yet supported. An empty list is returned.

| numReplicaMovements
| The number of partition replicas that will be moved between separate brokers.

*Performance impact during rebalance operation*: Relatively high.

| onDemandBalancednessScoreBefore +
onDemandBalancednessScoreAfter
| A measurement of the overall _balancedness_ of a Kafka Cluster, before and after the optimization proposal was generated.

The score is calculated by subtracting the sum of the `BalancednessScore` of each violated soft goal from 100. Cruise Control assigns a `BalancednessScore` to every optimization goal based on several factors, including priority--the goal's position in the list of `default.goals` or proposal-specific goals.

The `Before` score is based on the workload model of the Kafka cluster.
The `After` score is based on the predicted workload model after applying the generated optimization proposal.

| intraBrokerDataToMoveMB
| The sum of the size of each partition replica that will be moved between disks on the same broker (see also `numIntraBrokerReplicaMovements`).

*Performance impact during rebalance operation*: Variable. The larger the number, the longer the cluster rebalance will take to complete. Moving a large amount of data between disks on the same broker has less impact than between separate brokers (see `dataToMoveMB`).

| recentWindows
| The number of metrics windows upon which the optimization proposal is based.

| dataToMoveMB
| The sum of the size of each partition replica that will be moved to a separate broker (see also `numReplicaMovements`).

*Performance impact during rebalance operation*: Variable. The larger the number, the longer the cluster rebalance will take to complete.

| monitoredPartitionsPercentage
| The percentage of partitions in the Kafka cluster covered by the optimization proposal. Affected by the number of `excludedTopics`.

| excludedTopics
| If you specified a regular expression in the `spec.excludedTopicsRegex` property in the `KafkaRebalance` resource, all topic names matching that expression are listed here.
These topics are excluded from the calculation of partition replica/leader movements in the optimization proposal.

| numLeaderMovements
| The number of partitions whose leaders will be switched to different replicas.

*Performance impact during rebalance operation*: Relatively low.

| excludedBrokersForReplicaMove
| Not yet supported. An empty list is returned.

|===

=== Automatically approving an optimization proposal

To save time, you can automate the process of approving optimization proposals.
With automation, when you generate an optimization proposal it goes straight into a cluster rebalance.

To enable the optimization proposal auto-approval mechanism, create the `KafkaRebalance` resource with the `strimzi.io/rebalance-auto-approval` annotation set to `true`.
If the annotation is not set or set to `false`, the optimization proposal requires manual approval.

.Example rebalance request with auto-approval mechanism enabled
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/rebalance-auto-approval: "true"
spec:
  mode: # any mode
  # ...
----

You can still check the status when automatically approving an optimization proposal.
The status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource moves to `Ready` when the rebalance is complete.

=== Comparing broker load data

Broker load data provides insights into current and anticipated usage of resources following a rebalance.
The data is stored in a `ConfigMap` (with the same name as the `KafkaRebalance` resource) as a JSON formatted string

When a Kafka rebalance proposal reaches the `ProposalReady` state, Strimzi creates a `ConfigMap` (named after the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource) containing a JSON string of broker metrics generated from Cruise Control. 
Each broker has a set of key metrics represented by three values:

* The current metric value before the optimization proposal is applied
* The expected metric value after applying the proposal
* The difference between the two values (after minus before)

This `ConfigMap` remains accessible even after the rebalance completes.

To view this data from the command line, use the `ConfigMap` name.

.Returning ConfigMap data
[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe configmaps <my_rebalance_configmap_name> -n <namespace>
----

You can also use the `jq` {JQTool} to extract the JSON string.

| JSON property               | Description
| leaders                     | The number of replicas on this broker that are partition leaders.
| replicas                    | The number of replicas on this broker.
| cpuPercentage               | The CPU utilization as a percentage of the defined capacity.
| diskUsedPercentage          | The disk utilization as a percentage of the defined capacity.

| networkOutRate              | The total network output rate for the broker.
| leaderNetworkInRate         | The network input rate for all partition leader replicas on this broker.
| followerNetworkInRate       | The network input rate for all follower replicas on this broker.
| potentialMaxNetworkOutRate  | The hypothetical maximum network output rate that would be realized if this broker became the leader of all the replicas it currently hosts.

|===

=== Adjusting the cached proposal refresh rate

Cruise Control maintains a _cached optimization proposal_ based on the configured default optimization goals.
This proposal is generated from the workload model and updated every 15 minutes to reflect the current state of the Kafka cluster. 
When you generate an optimization proposal using the default goals, Cruise Control returns the latest cached version.

For clusters with rapidly changing workloads, you may want to shorten the refresh interval to ensure the optimization proposal reflects the most recent state. 
However, reducing the interval increases the load on the Cruise Control server. 
To adjust the refresh rate, modify the `proposal.expiration.ms` setting in the Cruise Control deployment configuration.
