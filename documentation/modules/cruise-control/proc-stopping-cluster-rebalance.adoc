= Stopping rebalances

[role="_abstract"]
Once started, a cluster rebalance operation might take some time to complete and affect the overall performance of the Kafka cluster.

If you want to stop a cluster rebalance operation that is in progress, apply the `stop` annotation to the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource.
This instructs Cruise Control to finish the current batch of partition reassignments and then stop the rebalance.
When the rebalance has stopped, completed partition reassignments have already been applied; therefore, the state of the Kafka cluster is different when compared to prior to the start of the rebalance operation.
If further rebalancing is required, you should generate a new optimization proposal.

NOTE: The performance of the Kafka cluster in the intermediate (stopped) state might be worse than in the initial state.

.Prerequisites

* The status of the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource is `Rebalancing`.

.Procedure

. Annotate the `KafkaRebalance` resource to stop the rebalance:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl annotate kafkarebalance <kafka_rebalance_resource_name> strimzi.io/rebalance="stop"
----

. Check the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance <kafka_rebalance_resource_name>
----

. Wait until the status changes to `Stopped`.
