= Capturing consumer lag metrics

[role="_abstract"]
Capture consumer group lag metrics to monitor whether consumers are keeping up with message production.
Consumer lag metrics help you detect slow or stalled consumers and diagnose processing issues.

Kafka Exporter exposes consumer group lag metrics that are not available through broker JMX metrics.
These metrics are typically scraped by Prometheus and visualized in monitoring dashboards.

Enable Kafka Exporter when you need to do the following:

* Monitor consumer group lag
* Track consumer progress over time
* Alert on slow consumers

Enable Kafka Exporter by adding a `kafkaExporter` section to the `Kafka` custom resource.
