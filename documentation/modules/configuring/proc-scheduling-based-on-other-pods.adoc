= Configuring pod anti-affinity against other workloads

[role="_abstract"]
To improve stability and performance, you can prevent Kafka pods from running on the same worker nodes as other resource-intensive applications, such as databases. 
Configure `podAntiAffinity` so that these workloads are scheduled on separate nodes.

This procedure provides configuration examples for the cluster-wide `Kafka` resource and the pool-specific `KafkaNodePool` resource.

NOTE: If you configure `KafkaNodePool.spec.template`, its settings replace `Kafka.spec.kafka.template` for that node pool.
Properties are not merged. 
For more information, see xref:affinity-{context}[Scheduling strategies].

.Prerequisites

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-str[The Cluster Operator must be deployed.] 
* The other workloads in your cluster use consistent labels.

.Procedure

. Configure `podAntiAffinity` in either the `Kafka` or `KafkaNodePool` resource.
+
--
* To set a cluster-wide rule, edit the `affinity` property in `spec.kafka.template.pod` of your `Kafka` resource. 
* To set a pool-specific rule, edit the `affinity` property in `spec.template.pod` of your `KafkaNodePool` resource. 
--
+
In both cases, use a `labelSelector` to identify the application pods you want to keep separate from your Kafka pods and set the `topologyKey` to `"kubernetes.io/hostname"` to prevent pods from being placed on the same host.
+
This example applies a rule to a `Kafka` resource named `my-cluster` that prevents any of its broker pods from running on the same node as pods labeled `postgresql` and `mongodb`.
