= Using example configuration files

[role="_abstract"]
Further enhance your deployment by incorporating additional supported configuration.
Example configuration files are included in the Strimzi xref:downloads-{context}[deployment files].
ifdef::Section[]
You can also access the example files directly from the
link:https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/{GithubVersion}/examples/[`examples` directory^].
endif::Section[]

The example files include only the essential properties and values for custom resources by default. 
You can download and apply the examples using the `kubectl` command-line tool.
The examples can serve as a starting point when building your own Kafka component configuration for deployment.

NOTE: If you installed Strimzi using the Operator, you can still download the example files and use them to upload configuration.

The release artifacts include an `examples` directory that contains the configuration examples.
