= Manually stopping or pausing MirrorMaker 2 connectors

[role="_abstract"]
If you are using `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resources to configure internal MirrorMaker connectors, use the `state` configuration to either stop or pause a connector.
In contrast to the paused state, where the connector and tasks remain instantiated, stopping a connector retains only the configuration, with no active processes.
Stopping a connector from running may be more suitable for longer durations than just pausing.
While a paused connector is quicker to resume, a stopped connector has the advantages of freeing up memory and resources.

NOTE: The `state` configuration replaces the (deprecated) `pause` configuration in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2ConnectorSpec` schema, which allows pauses on connectors. 
If you were previously using the `pause` configuration to pause connectors, we encourage you to transition to using the `state` configuration only to avoid conflicts.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Find the name of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource that controls the MirrorMaker 2 connector you want to pause or stop:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl get KafkaMirrorMaker2
----

. Edit the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource to stop or pause the connector.
+
.Example configuration for stopping a MirrorMaker 2 connector
[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaMirrorMaker2ApiVersion}
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2
metadata:
  name: my-mirror-maker2
spec:
  version: {DefaultKafkaVersion}
  replicas: 3
  target:
    # ...
  mirrors:
  - source:
      # ...
    sourceConnector:
      tasksMax: 10
      autoRestart:
        enabled: true
      state: stopped  
  # ...    
----
+
Change the `state` configuration to `stopped` or `paused`.
The default state for the connector when this property is not set is `running`.  

. Apply the changes to the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` configuration.
+
You can resume the connector by changing `state` to `running` or removing the configuration.

NOTE: Alternatively, you can xref:con-exposing-kafka-connect-api-str[expose the Kafka Connect API] and use the `stop` and `pause` endpoints to stop a connector from running.
For example, `PUT /connectors/<connector_name>/stop`.
You can then use the `resume` endpoint to restart it.
