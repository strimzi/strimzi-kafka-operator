= Configuring the HTTP Bridge

[role="_abstract"]
Configure your HTTP Bridge deployment by updating the `spec` properties of the `KafkaBridge` custom resource.

Start with a minimal configuration that defines the core requirements.
Extend it with optional settings to support the following:

* Securing connections to Kafka (TLS and authentication)
* Configuring HTTP endpoint settings, such as port and CORS
* Granting the HTTP Bridge access to Kafka resources
* Tuning consumer and producer behavior
* Running multiple HTTP Bridge instances
* xref:con-common-config-{context}[Common configuration], including resource limits and requests (recommended), JVM options, metrics, and pod scheduling
* xref:assembly-logging-configuration-{context}[Logging configuration]

Certain settings, though optional, are recommended for production deployments, such as security and resource allocation.

For details of all configuration options, see the link:{BookURLConfiguring}[Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference^].

== Minimal configuration for the HTTP Bridge

A minimal `KafkaBridge` resource must define:

* `.spec.bootstrapServers`: The bootstrap address for the Kafka cluster.
* `.spec.replicas`: The number of HTTP Bridge pods to deploy.
* `.spec.http.port`: The port on which the HTTP Bridge listens for client requests.

The Kafka cluster does not need to be managed by Strimzi or run on Kubernetes.

  # Replicas (required)

----

* `spec.replicas` specifies the number of HTTP Bridge replicas to run.
* `spec.bootstrapServers` specifies the bootstrap address for the Kafka cluster.
For a Strimzi-managed cluster, you can use the bootstrap service name, for example `<cluster_name>-kafka-bootstrap:<port>`.
* `spec.http.port` specifies the port used by the HTTP Bridge for incoming HTTP requests.
