= Specifying a maximum number of data replication tasks

[role="_abstract"]
Connectors create the tasks that are responsible for moving data in and out of Kafka.
Each connector comprises one or more tasks that are distributed across a group of worker pods that run the tasks.
Increasing the number of tasks can help with performance issues when replicating a large number of partitions or synchronizing the offsets of a large number of consumer groups.   

Tasks run in parallel.
Workers are assigned one or more tasks.
A single task is handled by one worker pod, so you don't need more worker pods than tasks.
If there are more tasks than workers, workers handle multiple tasks.

You can specify the maximum number of connector tasks in your MirrorMaker configuration using the `tasksMax` property.
Without specifying a maximum number of tasks, the default setting is a single task.

The heartbeat connector always uses a single task.

The number of tasks that are started for the source and checkpoint connectors is the lower value between the maximum number of possible tasks and the value for `tasksMax`.
For the source connector, the maximum number of tasks possible is one for each partition being replicated from the source cluster.
For the checkpoint connector, the maximum number of tasks possible is one for each consumer group being replicated from the source cluster.
When setting a maximum number of tasks, consider the number of partitions and the hardware resources that support the process.

If the infrastructure supports the processing overhead, increasing the number of tasks can improve throughput and latency.
For example, adding more tasks reduces the time taken to poll the source cluster when there is a high number of partitions or consumer groups.  

Increasing the number of tasks for the source connector is useful when you have a large number of partitions.

By default, MirrorMaker 2 checks for new consumer groups every 10 minutes. 
You can adjust the `refresh.groups.interval.seconds` configuration to change the frequency.
Take care when adjusting lower.
More frequent checks can have a negative impact on performance.   

== Checking connector task operations

If you are using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your deployment, you can check MirrorMaker 2 performance.
The example MirrorMaker 2 Grafana dashboard provided with Strimzi shows the following metrics related to tasks and latency.

* The number of tasks
* Replication latency
* Offset synchronization latency
