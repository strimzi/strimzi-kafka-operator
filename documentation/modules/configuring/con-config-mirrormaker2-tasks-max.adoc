= Specifying a maximum number of tasks

[role="_abstract"]
Connectors create the tasks that are responsible for moving data in and out of Kafka.
Each connector comprises one or more tasks that are distributed across a group of worker pods that run the tasks.

Tasks run in parallel.
Workers are assigned one or more tasks.
A single task is handled by one worker pod, so you don't need more worker pods than tasks.
If there are more tasks than workers, workers handle multiple tasks.

You can specify the maximum number of connector tasks in your MirrorMaker configuration using the `tasksMax` property.
Without specifying a maximum number of tasks, the default setting is a single task.
If the infrastructure supports the processing overhead, increasing the number of tasks can improve throughput.

For sink and source connectors, the maximum number of tasks that can run in parallel depends on a number of factors.
Common factors include the connector configuration, the type of external system, the expected throughput, and the number of workers.
A connector creates fewer than the maximum number of tasks if it cannot achieve the parallelism.
For sink connectors, the maximum number of tasks possible is one for each partition consumed.

Suppose a source connector is used to connect to a database as an external data source.
The connector might determine the required number of tasks based on the number of tables in the database and the maximum allowable number of tasks.
The source connector might create fewer tasks than the maximum allowed if it’s not possible or desirable to split the source data into so many tasks.
