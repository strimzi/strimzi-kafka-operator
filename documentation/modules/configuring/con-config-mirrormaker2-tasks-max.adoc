= Setting a maximum number of data replication tasks

[role="_abstract"]
Use `tasksMax` to control how many tasks are assigned to connectors. 
Increasing the number of tasks helps improve performance when replicating many partitions or synchronizing the offsets of a large number of consumer groups.

MirrorMaker 2 connectors create distributed tasks that move data between clusters. 
These tasks follow a set of operational behaviors and allocation rules.

Task behavior:

* Each task runs on a single worker pod.
* Tasks run in parallel.
* A worker pod can run multiple tasks, but each task runs in isolation.
* You donâ€™t need more pods than tasks. If there are fewer pods, tasks are distributed across available workers.

Task allocation rules:

* By default, connectors run with 1 task, unless `tasksMax` is set.
* For the `MirrorSourceConnector`, the maximum possible tasks = number of partitions.
* For the `MirrorCheckpointConnector`, the maximum possible tasks = number of consumer groups.
* Actual tasks started is the lower value of `tasksMax` and the maximum possible tasks.

If the infrastructure can support it, increasing the number of tasks improves throughput and reduces latency during high-volume replication.

Enable automatic restarts of failed connectors and tasks using `autoRestart`. 
By default, the number of restarts is indefinite, but you can set a maximum on the number of automatic restarts using the `maxRestarts` property.

Increasing the number of tasks for the checkpoint connector is useful when you have a large number of consumer groups.

By default, MirrorMaker 2 checks for new consumer groups every 10 minutes. 
You can adjust the `refresh.groups.interval.seconds` configuration to change the frequency.
Take care when adjusting lower.
More frequent checks can have a negative impact on performance.   

== Checking connector task operations

If you are using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your deployment, you can check MirrorMaker 2 performance.
The example MirrorMaker 2 Grafana dashboard provided with Strimzi shows the following metrics related to tasks and latency.

* The number of tasks
* Replication latency
* Offset synchronization latency
