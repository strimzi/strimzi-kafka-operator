= Configuring node pools

[role="_abstract"]
Update the `spec` properties of the `KafkaNodePool` custom resource to configure a node pool deployment.
A node pool is a distinct group of Kafka nodes within a Kafka cluster.
The `strimzi.io/cluster` metadata label identifies the name of the Kafka custom resource the pool belongs to.

Node pool configuration must define:

* Node roles within the cluster
* Number of replica nodes
* Storage specifications

The `.spec.roles` property defines whether the nodes in the pool act as controllers, brokers, or both.

Other optional properties may also be set in node pools:

* `resources` to specify memory and cpu requests and limits
* `template` to specify custom configuration for pods and other Kubernetes resources
* `jvmOptions` to specify custom JVM configuration for heap size, runtime and other options 

The relationship between `Kafka` and `KafkaNodePool` resources is as follows:

* `Kafka` resources represent the configuration for all nodes in a Kafka cluster.
* `KafkaNodePool` resources represent the configuration for nodes only in the node pool.

If a configuration property is not specified in `KafkaNodePool`, it is inherited from the `Kafka` resource.
Configuration specified in the `KafkaNodePool` resource takes precedence if set in both resources.
For example, if both the node pool and Kafka configuration includes `jvmOptions`, the values specified in the node pool configuration are used.
When `-Xmx: 1024m` is set in `KafkaNodePool.spec.jvmOptions` and `-Xms: 512m` is set in `Kafka.spec.kafka.jvmOptions`, the node uses the value from its node pool configuration.

The same properties defined in the template sections in `Kafka` and `KafkaNodePool` custom resources are not combined.
To clarify, if `KafkaNodePool.spec.template` includes only `podSet.metadata.labels`, and `Kafka.spec.kafka.template` includes `podSet.metadata.annotations` and `pod.metadata.labels`, the `pod.metadata.labels` template values from the Kafka configuration are used.
But the `podSet.metadata.annotations` template values are ignored since there is a `podSet` template value already present in the node pool configuration.

For a deeper understanding of the node pool configuration options, refer to the link:{BookURLConfiguring}[Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference^].

----
<1> Unique name for the node pool.
<2> The Kafka cluster the node pool belongs to. A node pool can only belong to a single cluster.
<3> Number of replicas for the nodes. 
<4> Roles for the nodes in the node pool. In this example, the nodes have dual roles as controllers and brokers.
<5> Storage specification for the nodes. 
<6> Requests for reservation of supported resources, currently `cpu` and `memory`, and limits to specify the maximum resources that can be consumed.

NOTE: The configuration for the `Kafka` resource must be suitable for KRaft mode. Currently, KRaft mode has xref:assembly-kraft-mode-{context}[a number of limitations].
