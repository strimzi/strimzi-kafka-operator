= Configuring MirrorMaker 2

[role="_abstract"]
Configure your MirrorMaker 2 deployment by updating the `spec` properties of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource.

Start with a minimal configuration that defines the core requirements.
Extend it with optional settings to support the following:

* Securing connections (TLS and authentication)
* Managing of replicated topic names
* Synchronizing consumer group offsets
* Synchronizing ACL rules
* Tuning Kafka Connect worker settings
* xref:con-common-config-{context}[common configuration] +
Common configuration includes setting resource limits and requests (recommended), JVM tuning, and metrics.

Certain settings, though optional, are recommended for production deployments, such as security and resource allocation.

For details of all configuration options, see the link:{BookURLConfiguring}[Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference^]. 

== Minimal configuration for MirrorMaker 2

A minimal `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource requires the following in its spec:

* `.spec.target`: The connection details for the target Kafka cluster. Requires a unique alias. MirrorMaker 2 runs on the Kafka Connect framework, and its configuration and status are stored on this cluster.
* `.spec.mirrors`: The replication flow from a source cluster to a target cluster. 
* `.spec.mirrors[].source`: The connection details for the source Kafka cluster. Requires a unique alias.
* `.spec.replicas`: The number of Kafka Connect worker pods to deploy.

By default, MirrorMaker 2 replicates all topics and consumer groups.  
To reduce load on the cluster and avoid replicating unnecessary data, specify which topics and groups to include using filters:

* `topicsPattern`: A regex to select topics for replication.
* `groupsPattern`: A regex to select consumer groups for offset synchronization.

----
<1> Number of Kafka Connect worker replicas to run.
<2> Configuration of the Kafka cluster used as the target cluster. This cluster will be also used by Kafka Connect to store internal topics.
<3> Defines replication between the source and target clusters. 
<4> Source cluster configuration must define a unique alias and a bootstrap address. The bootstrap address takes the format `<cluster_name>-kafka-bootstrap:<port>`.
<5> Configuration for the source connector that replicates topics. At a minimum, you can add an empty `sourceConnector` property to use the default configuration.
<6> Replicates only topics starting with `topic1` or `topic2`.
<7> Replicates consumer groups starting with `group1` or `group2` followed by two digits. 

NOTE: The Kafka clusters do not need to be managed by Strimzi or run on Kubernetes.
