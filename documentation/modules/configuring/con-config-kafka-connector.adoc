= Configuring Kafka Connect connectors

[role="_abstract"]
The `KafkaConnector` resource provides a Kubernetes-native approach to management of connectors by the Cluster Operator.
To create, delete, or reconfigure connectors with `KafkaConnector` resources, you must set the `use-connector-resources` annotation to `true`  in your `KafkaConnect` custom resource.

.Annotation to enable KafkaConnectors
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaConnectApiVersion}
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-connect-cluster
  annotations:
    strimzi.io/use-connector-resources: "true"
  # ...
----

When the `use-connector-resources` annotation is enabled in your `KafkaConnect` configuration, you must define and manage connectors using `KafkaConnector` resources. 

NOTE: Alternatively, you can manage connectors using the Kafka Connect REST API instead of `KafkaConnector` resources.
To use the API, you must remove the `strimzi.io/use-connector-resources` annotation to use `KafkaConnector` resources in the `KafkaConnect` the resource.

`KafkaConnector` resources provide the configuration needed to create connectors within a Kafka Connect cluster, which interacts with a Kafka cluster as specified in the `KafkaConnect` configuration. 
The Kafka cluster does not need to be managed by Strimzi or deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

The configuration also specifies how the connector instances interact with external data systems, including any required authentication methods. Additionally, you must define the data to watch. 
For example, in a source connector that reads data from a database, the configuration might include the database name. 
You can also define where this data should be placed in Kafka by specifying the target topic name.

Use the `tasksMax` property to specify the maximum number of tasks.
For instance, a source connector with `tasksMax: 2` might split the import of source data into two tasks.

To include external connector configurations, such as user access credentials stored in a secret, use the `externalConfiguration` property of the `KafkaConnect` resource. 
You can also load values using xref:assembly-loading-config-with-providers-str[configuration providers].
