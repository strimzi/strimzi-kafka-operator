= Configuring authorization

[role="_abstract"]
Control what authenticated clients can do in a Kafka cluster by enabling authorization on Kafka brokers.
Authorization is configured in the `Kafka` custom resource and enforced by the Kafka broker.

Authorization is separate from listener authentication.
Authentication verifies a client identity.
Authorization controls which operations the client is allowed to perform.

Kafka supports the following authorization types:

* `simple`
* `custom`

The `simple` authorization type uses the Kafka `StandardAuthorizer` plugin.

The following examples show how to enable authorization on Kafka brokers.

== Enabling simple authorization

Simple authorization enables ACL-based access control using Kafka’s built-in authorizer.

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
spec:
  kafka:
    # Authorization (optional)
    authorization:
      type: simple
----

* `spec.kafka.authorization.type: simple` enables ACL-based authorization using the Kafka `StandardAuthorizer`.
* Access to Kafka resources is controlled using ACL rules.

== Configuring super users

You can define super users that are allowed to perform all operations, regardless of ACL rules.
Use super users for Kafka administrator identities and internal components that must always be able to operate.

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
spec:
  kafka:
    # Authorization (optional)
    authorization:
      type: simple
      superUsers:
        - CN=kafka-admin
        - CN=my-team-admin
----

* `spec.kafka.authorization.superUsers` defines super user identities.
* The identity format must match the principal used by your authentication mechanism.

== Enabling custom authorization

Custom authorization allows the use of a custom authorizer implementation.
Use custom authorization when you need to integrate Kafka with an external authorization system.

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
spec:
  kafka:
    # Authorization (optional)
    authorization:
      type: custom
      authorizerClass: com.example.CustomAuthorizer
----

* `spec.kafka.authorization.type: custom` enables a custom authorization implementation.
* `spec.kafka.authorization.authorizerClass` specifies the fully qualified class name of the custom authorizer.

Authorization configuration enables enforcement of access control on the Kafka broker.
User identities, credentials, and ACL rules are configured separately.
