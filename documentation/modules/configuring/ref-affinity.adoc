= Scheduling strategies

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka components can be scheduled onto Kubernetes nodes using affinity rules, tolerations, and topology constraints.  
These strategies help isolate workloads, optimize resource usage, and improve overall cluster performance.

The following scheduling techniques support different deployment goals:

Use pod anti-affinity to avoid critical applications sharing nodes::
Use pod anti-affinity to prevent critical applications from being scheduled on the same disk.  
In Kafka deployments, configure pod anti-affinity to ensure that Kafka brokers do not share nodes with other workloads, such as databases.

Use node affinity to schedule workloads onto specific nodes::
Kubernetes clusters often include nodes optimized for different workloads, such as CPU, memory, storage, or network.  
Node affinity enables scheduling Kafka components onto nodes that match specific labels, such as `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type` or custom labels, to optimize performance and cost.

Use node affinity, taints, and tolerations for dedicated nodes::
To reserve nodes for Kafka, you can taint them to exclude them from general workloads. 
Kafka pods can still be scheduled onto these nodes by configuring:
+
--
* Tolerations, which allow the pods to bypass the taint.
* Node affinity, for the pods to run on those specific nodes.
--
+  
These settings direct Kafka pods to dedicated nodes while preventing other workloads from being scheduled there
This approach isolates Kafka from other workloads, reducing resource contention and improving stability.

Use topology spread constraints to balance pods across zones or nodes::
Topology spread constraints help distribute pods evenly across specified topology domains, such as zones, regions, or nodes.
For Kafka, this strategy reduces the risk of scheduling too many brokers on the same zone or node, improving availability and resilience.

You can apply these scheduling strategies in the `template.pod` property within the `spec` of a Strimzi custom resource. 

For Kafka brokers specifically, Strimzi provides a two-level configuration:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka.template.pod` +
Use this to set a cluster-wide default scheduling policy for all Kafka broker and controller pods.
* `KafkaNodePool.spec.template.pod` + 
For more granular control, if needed, you can override the default policy for specific node pools using the `KafkaNodePool` resource.

IMPORTANT: If a property is defined under `KafkaNodePool.spec.template` and the same property is defined also under `Kafka.spec.kafka.template`, the property from the node pool will be used.
In other words, node pools using `KafkaNodePool.spec.template.pod` settings do not inherit the Pod settings from the cluster-wide template.

Other Strimzi components have their own template properties for scheduling:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka.template.pod`
* `KafkaNodePool.spec.template.pod`
* `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.template.pod`
* `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.template.pod`
* `KafkaConnect.spec.template.pod`
* `KafkaBridge.spec.template.pod`
* `KafkaMirrorMaker2.spec.template.pod`

The following procedures provide scheduling configuration examples for the `Kafka` and `KafkaNodePool` resources. 
The same configurations shown in these examples can be applied to the `template.pod` property of any other component.

Scheduling properties follow the Kubernetes specification.
