= Applying optional common configuration

[role="_abstract"]
You can further configure Strimzi components by applying any of the following optional common configuration settings. 
Common configuration is configured independently for each component, such as the following:

* Resource limits and requests (Recommended)
* Metrics configuration
* Liveness and readiness probes
* JVM options for maximum and minimum memory allocation
* Adding additional volumes and volume mounts
* Template configuration for pods and containers
* Logging frequency

Advanced or specialized options include:

* Custom container images
* Rack awareness
* Distributed tracing

Configure common options for Strimzi custom resources in the `.spec` section of the custom resource.
For more information on these configuration options, refer to link:{BookURLConfiguring}[Common configuration properties^].

== Resource limits and requests (recommended)

To ensure stability and optimal performance for your Kafka clusters, we recommend defining CPU and memory resource limits and requests for all Strimzi containers. 
By default, the Strimzi Cluster Operator does not set these values, but fine-tuning them based on your workload requirements helps performance and improves reliability.

.Example resource configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "1"
      memory: 2Gi
    limits:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: 2Gi
  # ...    
----

== Metrics configuration

Enable metrics collection for monitoring.

.Example metrics configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  metricsConfig:
    type: jmxPrometheusExporter
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-metrics-config
        key: kafka-metrics-config.yml
  # ...      
----

Configuration varies depending on the component and exporter used: Prometheus JMX Exporter or Strimzi Metrics Reporter. 
For more information, see xref:assembly-metrics-str[Introducing metrics]. 

== Liveness and readiness probes

Configure health checks for the container.

.Example liveness and readiness probes
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  livenessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 15
    timeoutSeconds: 5
  readinessProbe:
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
    timeoutSeconds: 5
  # ...  
----

== JVM options

Configure the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for the component.
To enable garbage collector (GC) logging, set `gcLoggingEnabled` to `true`.

.Example JVM options
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  jvmOptions:
    -Xms: "512m"
    -Xmx: "1g"
    gcLoggingEnabled: true
  # ...  
----

== Additional volumes and mounts

Add extra volumes to the container and mount them in specific locations.

.Example additional volumes
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  kafka:
    template:
      pod:
        volumes:
          - name: example-secret
            secret:
              secretName: secret-name
          - name: example-configmap
            configMap:
              name: config-map-name
      kafkaContainer:
        volumeMounts:
          - name: example-secret
            mountPath: /mnt/secret-volume
          - name: example-configmap
            mountPath: /mnt/cm-volume
  # ...          
----

NOTE: You can use `template` configuration to add other customizations to pods and containers, such as affinity and security context. 
For more information, see xref:assembly-scheduling-str[Configuring pod scheduling] and xref:assembly-security-providers-str[Applying security context to Strimzi pods and containers].

== Custom container image

Override the default container image.
*Use only in special situations.*

.Example custom image
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  image: my-org/custom-kafka-image:latest
  # ...
----

[id='con-common-config-rack-awareness-{context}']
== Rack awareness

Enable rack-aware broker assignment to improve fault tolerance.
*This is a specialized option intended for a deployment within the same location, not across regions.* 

.Example rack awareness configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
rack:
  topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
# ...
----

IMPORTANT: With the rack awareness enabled, Strimzi will automatically set the rack (zone) information from the `topologyKey` label in the Kafka configuration.
It will also automatically add a node affinity rule to make sure the Pods are scheduled only on the nodes that have the `topologyKey` label.
But it will not add any anti-affinity or topology spread constraints to spread the Pods across the racks/zones.
To do so, make sure to add your own rules in the `Kafka` or `KafkaNodePool` custom resources.
For more information see xref:proc-distributing-brokers-across-zones-{context}[Distributing brokers across availability zones]

== Distributed tracing configuration

Enable distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry to monitor Kafka component operations.

.Example tracing configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  tracing:
    type: opentelemetry
  # ...  
----

For more information see xref:assembly-distributed-tracing-str[Introducing distributed tracing].
