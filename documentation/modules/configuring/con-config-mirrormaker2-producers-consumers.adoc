= Configuring MirrorMaker 2 connector producers and consumers

[role="_abstract"]
MirrorMaker 2 connectors use internal producers and consumers.
If needed, you can configure these producers and consumers to override the default settings. 

For example, you can increase the `batch.size` for the source producer that sends topics to the target Kafka cluster to better accommodate large volumes of messages.

IMPORTANT: Producer and consumer configuration options depend on the MirrorMaker 2 implementation, and may be subject to change.  

The following tables describe the producers and consumers for each of the connectors and where you can add configuration. 

.Source connector producers and consumers
[cols="1,1a,3m",options="header"]
|===

|Type
|Description
|Configuration

|Producer
|Sends topic messages to the target Kafka cluster. Consider tuning the configuration of this producer when it is handling large volumes of data. 
|mirrors.sourceConnector.config: producer.override.*

|Producer
|Writes to the `offset-syncs` topic, which maps the source and target offsets for replicated topic partitions. 
|mirrors.sourceConnector.config: producer.*

|Consumer
|Retrieves topic messages from the source Kafka cluster.
|mirrors.sourceConnector.config: consumer.* 
|===

.Checkpoint connector producers and consumers
[cols="1,1a,3m",options="header"]
|===

|Type
|Description
|Configuration

|Producer
|Emits consumer offset checkpoints.
|mirrors.checkpointConnector.config: producer.override.* 

|Consumer
|Loads the `offset-syncs` topic.
|mirrors.checkpointConnector.config: consumer.*

|===

NOTE: You can set `offset-syncs.topic.location` to `target` to use the target Kafka cluster as the location of the `offset-syncs` topic.

The following example shows how you configure the producers and consumers.
