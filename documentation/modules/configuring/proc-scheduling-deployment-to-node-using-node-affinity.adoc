= Configuring pod scheduling for specific nodes

[role="_abstract"]
Your Kubernetes cluster might have different types of worker nodes, some with specialized hardware (fast SSDs, powerful CPUs) or a particular location (a specific availability zone). 
To optimize performance and resource usage, configure `nodeAffinity` so that Kafka pods are scheduled only on the nodes that match your requirements.

This procedure provides configuration examples for the cluster-wide `Kafka` resource and the pool-specific `KafkaNodePool` resource.

NOTE: If a property is defined under `KafkaNodePool.spec.template` and the same property is defined also under `Kafka.spec.kafka.template`, the property from the node pool will be used.
Properties are not merged. 
For more information, see xref:affinity-{context}[Scheduling strategies].

.Prerequisites

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-str[The Cluster Operator must be deployed.]  
* Worker nodes are labeled to identify their specific characteristics (such as `disk:sdd`).

.Procedure

. Label the worker nodes to identify them when scheduling the kafka pods.

. Configure `nodeAffinity` in either the `Kafka` or `KafkaNodePool` resource to match the label.
+
--
* To set a cluster-wide rule, edit the `affinity` property in `spec.kafka.template.pod` of your `Kafka` resource.
* To set a pool-specific rule, edit the `affinity` property in `spec.template.pod` of your `KafkaNodePool` resource.
--
+
In both cases, use `nodeSelectorTerms` with `matchExpressions` to specify the key-value label of the nodes you want to schedule pods on.
+
This example applies a rule to a `Kafka` resource that assigns all its broker pods to run only on nodes with the label `disk: ssd`.

.Example availability zone scheduling for node pools
For node pools, a common production scenario is to configure node pools so that pods are scheduled only on nodes within a specified availability zone. 
For more information, see xref:proc-managing-storage-affinity-node-pools-str[Managing storage affinity using node pools]

. Apply the changes to your custom resource configuration.
