= MirrorMaker 2.0 data replication

MirrorMaker 2.0 consumes messages from a source Kafka cluster and writes them to a target Kafka cluster.

MirrorMaker 2.0 uses:

* Source cluster configuration to consume data from the source cluster
* Target cluster configuration to output data to the target cluster

MirrorMaker 2.0 is based on the Kafka Connect framework, _connectors_ managing the transfer of data between clusters.
A MirrorMaker 2.0 `MirrorSourceConnector` replicates topics from a source cluster to a target cluster.

By default, a check for new topics in the source cluster is made every 10 minutes.
You can change the frequency by adding `refresh.topics.interval.seconds` to the source connector configuration of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource.
However, increasing the frequency of the operation might affect overall performance.

The process of _mirroring_ data from one cluster to another cluster is asynchronous.
The recommended pattern is for messages to be produced locally alongside the source Kafka cluster, then consumed remotely close to the target Kafka cluster.

MirrorMaker 2.0 can be used with more than one source cluster.

= Cluster configuration

You can use MirrorMaker 2.0 in _active/passive_ or _active/active_ cluster configurations.

* In an _active/active_ configuration, both clusters are active and provide the same data simultaneously, which is useful if you want to make the same data available locally in different geographical locations.
* In an _active/passive_ configuration, the data from an active cluster is replicated in a passive cluster, which remains on standby, for example, for data recovery in the event of system failure.

The expectation is that producers and consumers connect to active clusters only.

A MirrorMaker 2.0 cluster is required at each target destination.

== Bidirectional replication (active/active)

The MirrorMaker 2.0 architecture supports bidirectional replication in an _active/active_ cluster configuration.

Each cluster replicates the data of the other cluster using the concept of _source_ and _remote_ topics.
As the same topics are stored in each cluster, remote topics are automatically renamed by MirrorMaker 2.0 to represent the source cluster.
The name of the originating cluster is prepended to the name of the topic.

By flagging the originating cluster, topics are not replicated back to that cluster.

The concept of replication through _remote_ topics is useful when configuring an architecture that requires data aggregation.
Consumers can subscribe to source and remote topics within the same cluster, without the need for a separate aggregation cluster.

== Unidirectional replication (active/passive)

The MirrorMaker 2.0 architecture supports unidirectional replication in an _active/passive_ cluster configuration.

You can use an _active/passive_ cluster configuration to make backups or migrate data to another cluster.
In this situation, you might not want automatic renaming of remote topics.

You can override automatic renaming by adding `IdentityReplicationPolicy` to the source connector configuration of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource.
With this configuration applied, topics retain their original names.

== Topic configuration synchronization

Topic configuration is automatically synchronized between source and target clusters.
By synchronizing configuration properties, the need for rebalancing is reduced.

== Data integrity

MirrorMaker 2.0 monitors source topics and propagates any configuration changes to remote topics, checking for and creating missing partitions.
Only MirrorMaker 2.0 can write to remote topics.

== Offset tracking
MirrorMaker 2.0 tracks offsets for consumer groups using _internal topics_.

* The _offset sync_ topic maps the source and target offsets for replicated topic partitions from record metadata
* The _checkpoint_ topic maps the last committed offset in the source and target cluster for replicated topic partitions in each consumer group

Offsets for the _checkpoint_ topic are tracked at predetermined intervals through configuration.
Both topics enable replication to be fully restored from the correct offset position on failover.

MirrorMaker 2.0 uses its `MirrorCheckpointConnector` to emit _checkpoints_ for offset tracking.

== Synchronizing consumer group offsets

The `__consumer_offsets` topic stores information on committed offsets, according to consumer group.
Offset synchronization periodically transfers the consumer offsets for the consumer groups of a source cluster into the consumer offsets topic of a target cluster.

Offset synchronization is particularly useful in an _active/passive_ configuration.
Should the active cluster go down, consumer applications can switch to the passive (standby) cluster and pick up from the last offset position.

To use topic offset synchronization:

* Enable the synchronization by adding `sync.group.offsets.enabled` to the checkpoint connector configuration of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource,
and setting the property to `true`. Synchronization is disabled by default.
* Add the `IdentityReplicationPolicy` to the source connector configuration so that topics in the target cluster retain their original names.

For topic offset synchronization to work, consumer groups in the source cluster cannot be active in the target cluster.
Consequently, if you are using an _active/active_ configuration that does not support or require offset synchronization, do not enable topic offset synchronization.

If enabled, the synchronization of offsets from the source cluster is made periodically.
You can change the frequency by adding `sync.group.offsets.interval.seconds` and `emit.checkpoints.interval.seconds` to the checkpoint connector configuration.
The properties specify the frequency in seconds that the consumer group offsets are synchronized, and the frequency of checkpoints emitted for offset tracking.
The default for both properties is 60 seconds.

== Connectivity checks

A _heartbeat_ internal topic checks connectivity between clusters.

The _heartbeat_ topic is replicated from the source cluster.

Target clusters use the topic to check:

* The connector managing connectivity between clusters is running
* The source cluster is available

MirrorMaker 2.0 uses its `MirrorHeartbeatConnector` to emit _heartbeats_ that perform these checks.
