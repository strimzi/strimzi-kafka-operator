= Configuring pod anti-affinity for Kafka nodes

[role="_abstract"]
To improve fault tolerance, you can prevent multiple Kafka broker pods from running on the same worker node.
Configure `podAntiAffinity` so that the pods are scheduled on different worker nodes. 

This procedure provides configuration examples for the cluster-wide `Kafka` resource and the pool-specific `KafkaNodePool` resource.

NOTE: If you configure `KafkaNodePool.spec.template`, its settings replace `Kafka.spec.kafka.template` for that node pool.
Properties are not merged. 
For more information, see xref:affinity-{context}[Scheduling strategies].

.Prerequisites

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-str[The Cluster Operator must be deployed.]  

.Procedure

. Configure `podAntiAffinity` in either the `Kafka` or `KafkaNodePool` resource.
+
--
* To set a cluster-wide rule, edit the `affinity` property in `spec.kafka.template.pod` of your `Kafka` resource. 
Use the `strimzi.io/name` label to select all broker pods.
* To set a pool-specific rule, edit the `affinity` property in `spec.template.pod` of your `KafkaNodePool` resource. 
Use the `strimzi.io/pool-name` label to select only the pods in that pool.
--
+
In both cases, set the `topologyKey` to `"kubernetes.io/hostname"` to prevent pods from being placed on the same host.
+
This example applies a rule to a `Kafka` resource named `my-cluster` that prevents any of its broker pods from running on the same node.

This example applies a rule to a `KafkaNodePool` resource named `broker` that prevents pods from that specific pool from running on the same node.
