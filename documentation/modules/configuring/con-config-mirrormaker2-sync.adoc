= Synchronizing consumer group offsets

[role="_abstract"]
Configure MirrorMaker 2 to synchronize consumer group offsets from the source cluster to the target cluster.

The `MirrorSourceConnector` and `MirrorCheckpointConnector` work together using internal topics to coordinate offset tracking between clusters.

`offset-syncs` topic:: Format: `mm2-offset-syncs<separator><cluster_alias><separator>internal` +
Populated by the `MirrorSourceConnector`, this topic stores offset mappings between source and target clusters. By default, it's created in the source cluster.
`checkpoints` topic:: 
Format: `<cluster_alias><separator>checkpoints<separator>internal` +
Populated by the `MirrorCheckpointConnector` in the target cluster, this topic captures the last committed offsets for each consumer group.

Configuring the `MirrorCheckpointConnector` to emit periodic offset checkpoints enables:

* Active/passive offset synchronization
* Failover recovery as consumers switch to the target cluster at the correct position

Offset synchronization occurs at regular intervals.
The `MirrorCheckpointConnector` emits checkpoints for all consumer groups.
However, applying those checkpoints in the target cluster requires the target group to be inactive.
If consumers switch to the target cluster between checkpoints, they might reprocess some messages because the last synchronized offset lags behind the source.
This duplication is expected.

NOTE: The connector continues to emit checkpoints to the checkpoints topic even if the target consumer group is active. 
However, the offsets cannot be committed while the group has active members. 
In this case, the connector logs a warning and the offsets are not synchronized.

<1> Replication factor for the `offset-syncs` internal topic that maps the offsets of the source and target clusters. 
A value of -1 uses the broker’s default replication factor, which is typically set to provide resilience (for example, 3).
<2> Optional setting to change the frequency of checks for new topics.
<3> Enables consumer group offset synchronization.
<4> The frequency of the synchronization.
<5> Adjusts the frequency of checks for offset tracking. If you change the frequency of offset synchronization, you might also need to adjust the frequency of these checks.  
<6> The frequency of checks for new consumer groups.
<7> Replication factor for the internal checkpoints topic that stores the last committed offsets for each consumer group. 
A value of -1 uses the broker’s default replication factor, which is typically set to provide resilience (for example, 3).

TIP: If you have an application written in Java, you can use the `RemoteClusterUtils.java` utility to fetch offsets through the application. 
The utility fetches remote offsets for a consumer group from the `checkpoints` topic.

== Changing the location of the consumer group offsets topic

The location of the `offset-syncs` topic is the `source` cluster by default.
You can use the `offset-syncs.topic.location` connector configuration to change this to the `target` cluster.
You need read/write access to the cluster that contains the topic.
Using the target cluster as the location of the `offset-syncs` topic allows you to use MirrorMaker 2 even if you have only read access to the source cluster.

== Listing the offsets of connectors

To list the offset positions of the internal MirrorMaker 2 connectors, use the same configuration that's used to manage Kafka Connect connectors.
For more information on setting up the configuration and listing offsets, see xref:proc-listing-connector-offsets-{context}[].

In this example, the `sourceConnector` configuration is updated to return the connector offset position.
The offset information is written to a specified `ConfigMap`.

You must apply the following annotations to the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource be able to manage connector offsets:

* `strimzi.io/connector-offsets`
* `strimzi.io/mirrormaker-connector`

The `strimzi.io/mirrormaker-connector` annotation must be set to the name of the connector.
These annotations remain until the operation succeeds or they are manually removed from the resource.

MirrorMaker 2 connectors are named using the aliases of the source and target clusters, followed by the connector type: `<source_alias>&#45;&#62;<target_alias>.<connector_type>`.

In the following example, the annotations are applied for a connector named `my-cluster-source&#45;&#62;my-cluster-target.MirrorSourceConnector`.

.Example application of annotations for connector

----
kubectl annotate kafkamirrormaker2 my-mirror-maker-2 strimzi.io/connector-offsets=list strimzi.io/mirrormaker-connector="my-cluster-source->my-cluster-target.MirrorSourceConnector" -n kafka
----

The offsets are listed in the specified `ConfigMap`.
Strimzi puts the offset information into a `.json` property named after the connector. 
This does not overwrite any other properties when updating an existing `ConfigMap`.

<1> The owner reference pointing to the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource. 
To provide a custom owner reference, create the `ConfigMap` in advance and set the owner reference.
<2> The `.json` property uses the connector name. Since `&#45;&#62;` characters are not allowed in `ConfigMap` keys, `&#45;&#62;` is changed to `--` in the connector name.

NOTE: It is possible to use configuration to xref:proc-altering-connector-offsets-{context}[alter] or xref:proc-resetting-connector-offsets-{context}[reset] connector offsets, though this is rarely necessary.
