= Changing node pool roles

[role="_abstract"]
Node pools are used with Kafka clusters that operate in KRaft mode (using Kafka Raft metadata).
If you are using KRaft mode, you can specify roles for all nodes in the node pool to operate as brokers, controllers, or both.

In certain circumstances you might want to change the roles assigned to a node pool.
For example, you may have a node pool that contains nodes that perform dual broker and controller roles, and then decide to split the roles between two node pools.
In this case, you create a new node pool with nodes that act only as brokers, and then reassign partitions from the dual-role nodes to the new brokers.
You can then switch the old node pool to a controller-only role.

You can also perform the reverse operation by moving from node pools with controller-only and broker-only roles to a node pool that contains nodes that perform dual broker and controller roles.
In this case, you add the `broker` role to the existing controller-only node pool, reassign partitions from the broker-only nodes to the dual-role nodes, and then delete the broker-only node pool.

When removing `broker` roles in the node pool configuration, keep in mind that Kafka does not automatically reassign partitions.
Before removing the broker role, ensure that nodes changing to controller-only roles do not have any assigned partitions. 
If partitions are assigned, the change is prevented.
No replicas must be left on the node before removing the broker role.
The best way to reassign partitions before changing roles is to apply a Cruise Control optimization proposal in `remove-brokers` mode.

NOTE: Scaling controller nodes in node pools is currently not supported because the related Kafka feature is still under development.
