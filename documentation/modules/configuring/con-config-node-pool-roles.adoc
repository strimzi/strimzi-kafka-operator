= Changing node pool roles

[role="_abstract"]
Node pools can be used with Kafka clusters that operate in KRaft mode (using Kafka Raft metadata) or use ZooKeeper for metadata management.
If you are using KRaft mode, you can specify roles for all nodes in the node pool to operate as brokers, controllers, or both.
If you are using ZooKeeper, nodes must be set as brokers only.

In certain circumstances you might want to change the roles assigned to a node pool.
For example, you may have a node pool that contains nodes that perform dual broker and controller roles, and then decide to split the roles between two node pools.
In this case, you create a new node pool with nodes that act only as brokers, and then reassign partitions from the dual-role nodes to the new brokers.
You can then switch the old node pool to a controller-only role.

When removing `broker` roles in the node pool configuration, keep in mind that Kafka does not automatically reassign partitions.
Before removing the broker role, ensure that nodes changing to controller-only roles do not have any assigned partitions. 
If partitions are assigned, the change is prevented.
No replicas must be left on the node before removing the broker role.
The best way to reassign partitions before changing roles is to apply a Cruise Control optimization proposal in `remove-brokers` mode.
