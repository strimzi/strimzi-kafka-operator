Before running the Strimzi API conversion tool, confirm that your environment meets the following prerequisites.

== General prerequisites

Applies to all conversion commands (`convert-file`, `convert-resource`, `crd-upgrade`):

* All Strimzi custom resources are backed up.
* You have reviewed any manual changes required for deprecated or unsupported `v1` API fields.

== Cluster conversion prerequisites

Applies only when running the tool against a Kubernetes cluster (`convert-resource`, `crd-upgrade`):

* The deployed Strimzi Cluster Operator version is 0.49.0 or later.
* You have identified the namespaces containing Strimzi resources to convert.
* The user or service account running the tool has the required RBAC permissions:
** For `convert-resource`: `list`, `get`, and `replace` permissions for all Strimzi custom resources.
** For `crd-upgrade`: `patch` permissions for Custom Resource Definitions.
