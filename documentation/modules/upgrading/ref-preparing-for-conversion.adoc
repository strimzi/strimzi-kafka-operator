Before running the Strimzi API conversion tool, confirm that the environment meets the prerequisites for converting Strimzi custom resources and CRDs to the `v1` API.

Before running the Strimzi API conversion tool, verify that the following conditions are met:

* The deployed Strimzi version is 0.49 or later.  
* All Strimzi custom resources and CRDs are backed up.
* The namespaces that contain Strimzi resources to be converted are identified.  
* The user or service account running the tool has RBAC permissions to list, get, and replace Strimzi custom resources.  
* Any deprecated or unsupported fields in the `v1` API are reviewed, and manual changes are planned as needed.
