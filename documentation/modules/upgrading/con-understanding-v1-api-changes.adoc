= Manual and automatic v1 API changes

[role="_abstract"]
The Strimzi `v1` API introduces structural and configuration changes to custom resources.
Some properties and sections from earlier API versions have been removed or replaced. 

Custom resources can be updated for the `v1` API in two ways:

* By using the Strimzi API conversion tool to apply supported automatic changes.
* By editing and reapplying resources manually without using the tool.

Even when the conversion tool is used, some changes must still be applied manually because the tool cannot modify or remove the unsupported configuration.  
The reference information in this section lists which changes the tool can perform automatically and which require manual updates.

.Manual changes

Manual changes are updates that the conversion tool does not apply automatically.  

To apply a manual change:

. Edit the affected custom resource.
. Update or remove the required properties.
. Reapply the resource using `kubectl apply -f` or `kubectl replace -f`.

.Automatic changes

Automatic changes are updates that the conversion tool applies during conversion.  
Even when the conversion tool is used, some manual changes are still required for the custom resources.
