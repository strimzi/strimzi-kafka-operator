= Updating listener configuration

Strimzi provides a `GenericKafkaListener` schema for the configuration of Kafka listeners in a `Kafka` resource.

`GenericKafkaListener` replaces the `KafkaListeners` schema, which has been removed from Strimzi.

With the `GenericKafkaListener` schema, you can configure as many listeners as required,
as long as their names and ports are unique.
The `listeners` configuration is defined as an array, but the deprecated format is also supported.

For clients inside the Kubernetes cluster, you can create `plain` (without encryption) or `tls` _internal_ listeners.

For clients outside the Kubernetes cluster, you create _external_ listeners and specify a connection mechanism,
which can be `nodeport`, `loadbalancer`, `ingress` or `route`.

The `KafkaListeners` schema used sub-properties for `plain`, `tls` and `external` listeners, with fixed ports for each.
At any stage in the upgrade process, you must convert listeners configured using the `KafkaListeners` schema into the format of the `GenericKafkaListener` schema.

For example, if you are currently using the following configuration in your `Kafka` configuration:

.Old listener configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
listeners:
  plain:
    # ...
  tls:
    # ...
  external:
    type: loadbalancer
    # ...
----

Convert the listeners into the new format using:

.New listener configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
listeners:
  #...
  - name: plain
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: false <1>
  - name: tls
    port: 9093
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external
    port: 9094
    type: _EXTERNAL-LISTENER-TYPE_ <2>
    tls: true
----
<1> The TLS property is now required for all listeners.
<2> Options: `ingress`, `loadbalancer`, `nodeport`, `route`.

Make sure to use the *exact* names and port numbers shown.

For any additional `configuration` or `overrides` properties used with the old format, you need to update them to the new format.

Changes introduced to the listener `configuration`:

* `overrides` is merged with the `configuration` section
* `dnsAnnotations` has been renamed `annotations`
* `preferredAddressType` has been renamed `preferredNodePortAddressType`
* `address` has been renamed `alternativeNames`
* `loadBalancerSourceRanges` and `externalTrafficPolicy` move to the listener configuration from the now deprecated `template`

For example, this configuration:

.Old additional listener configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
listeners:
  external:
    type: loadbalancer
    authentication:
      type: tls
    overrides:
      bootstrap:
        dnsAnnotations:
          #...
----

Changes to:

.New additional listener configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
listeners:
    #...
  - name: external
    port: 9094
    type:loadbalancer
    tls: true
    authentication:
      type: tls
    configuration:
      bootstrap:
        annotations:
          #...
----

IMPORTANT: The name and port numbers shown in the new listener configuration *must* be used for backwards compatibility.
Using any other values will cause renaming of the Kafka listeners and Kubernetes services.
