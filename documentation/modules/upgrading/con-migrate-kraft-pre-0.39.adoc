= Migrating to KRaft from versions earlier than 0.39

Direct upgrades to Strimzi {ProductVersion} from versions earlier than 0.39 are **not supported**.

Before you can upgrade to {ProductVersion}, you **must** follow this required path:

. Upgrade your cluster to a Strimzi version between 0.39 and 0.45.
. Migrate your cluster from ZooKeeper to KRaft.

For more information, see xref:assembly-kraft-mode-{context}[Using Kafka in KRaft mode].

After your cluster is running on KRaft, you can proceed with the upgrade to Strimzi {ProductVersion}.
