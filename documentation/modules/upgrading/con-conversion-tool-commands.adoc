= Conversion tool commands

[role="_abstract"]
The Strimzi API conversion tool provides commands to convert Strimzi custom resources and upgrade Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to the `v1` API.

Each command runs through a shell script located in the `bin` directory.

Run the tool using the following command format:

[source,shell]
----
bin/v1-api-conversion.sh <command>
----

If you are using Windows, run `bin/v1-api-conversion.cmd` instead.

The following commands are available for converting custom resources and upgrading CRDs:

`convert-file`::  
Converts Strimzi custom resources from local YAML files.  
Use this command when applying configuration through GitOps or when direct cluster access is restricted.

`convert-resource`::  
Converts existing Strimzi custom resources directly in Kubernetes.  
Use this command when updating live environments managed by the Cluster Operator.

`crd-upgrade`::  
Upgrades Strimzi CRDs to use the `v1` API as the storage version.  
Run this command only after all custom resources have been converted.

`help`::
Use the `help` command to list available commands and options or to display detailed help for a specific command.

[source,shell]
----
bin/v1-api-conversion.sh help
bin/v1-api-conversion.sh help <command>

For example, run `bin/v1-api-conversion.sh help convert-file` to see the supported options for converting YAML files.

NOTE: As an alternative to running the tool locally from your computer, you can also run it as a Kubernetes `Job`.
For more information, see the `README.md` file in the conversion tool.
