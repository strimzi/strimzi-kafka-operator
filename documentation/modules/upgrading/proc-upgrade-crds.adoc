= Upgrading CRDs to the v1 API

[role="_abstract"]
Use the Strimzi API conversion tool with the `crd-upgrade` command to upgrade the Strimzi Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to use the `v1` API as the storage version.

If you run this operation from a Kubernetes `Job`, replace `convert-resource` with `crd-upgrade` in the container command.  

IMPORTANT: This command finalizes the API conversion by removing the `v1beta2` version from the CRDs.
You can run this command any time after converting all your custom resources to `v1`, but it **must** be completed as a *final step just before* upgrading to the release that completely removes the `v1beta2` API (planned for 0.52.0 or 1.0.0).

.Prerequisites

* All Strimzi custom resources have been converted to `v1`.  
* Permissions to patch CRD resources and replace their status.

.Procedure

. Run `crd-upgrade`:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/v1-api-conversion.sh crd-upgrade
----

. Verify that all Strimzi CRDs use the `v1` API as the storage version:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get crd -o name | grep kafka.strimzi.io | while read crd; do
  echo -n "$crd  "
  kubectl get "$crd" -o jsonpath='{.status.storedVersions}{"\n"}'
done
----
+
Confirm that all CRDs return `[v1]` as the stored version.

. After upgrading the CRDs, use only the properties supported in the `v1` API in all custom resources.
