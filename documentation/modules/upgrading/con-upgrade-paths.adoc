= Strimzi upgrade paths

[role="_abstract"]
Two upgrade paths are available for Strimzi.

Incremental upgrade::
An incremental upgrade moves between consecutive minor versions (such as {ProductVersionPrevious} to {ProductVersion}), following a supported upgrade path.

Multi-version upgrade::
A multi-version upgrade skips one or more minor versions. 
While temporary errors due to Kafka version changes may occur, they can typically be resolved during the upgrade.  

Before upgrading in production, test your specific scenario in a controlled environment to identify potential issues.

== Support for Kafka versions when upgrading

When upgrading Strimzi, it is important to ensure compatibility with the Kafka version being used.

Multi-version upgrades are possible even if the supported Kafka versions differ between the old and new versions. 
However, if you attempt to upgrade to a new Strimzi version that does not support the current Kafka version, xref:con-upgrade-cluster-operator-unsupported-kafka-str[an error indicating that the Kafka version is not supported is generated]. 
In this case, you must upgrade the Kafka version as part of the Strimzi upgrade by changing the `spec.kafka.version` in the `Kafka` custom resource to the supported version for the new Strimzi version.

[NOTE]
====
You can review supported Kafka versions in the link:https://strimzi.io/downloads/[Supported versions^] table.

* The *Operators* column lists all released Strimzi versions (the Strimzi version is often called the "Operator version").
* The *Kafka versions* column lists the supported Kafka versions for each Strimzi version.

== Upgrading from a Strimzi version earlier than 0.39

Strimzi {ProductVersion} supports upgrades only for KRaft-based Apache Kafka clusters managed by Strimzi 0.39 and newer.
When upgrading from older Strimzi versions, please make sure to first upgrade to a Strimzi version from 0.39 to 0.45 and migrate to KRaft before upgrading to Strimzi {ProductVersion}.
