= Upgrading CRDs to {ApiVersion} using the API conversion tool

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes how to use the API conversion tool to convert the CRDs that define the schemas used to instantiate and manage Strimzi-specific resources in a format applicable to `{ApiVersion}`.
To do so, you use the `crd-upgrade` command.

*Perform this procedure after converting all Strimzi custom resources in the whole Kubernetes cluster to `{ApiVersion}`.*
If you upgrade your CRDs first, and then convert your custom resources, you will need to run this command again.

The command updates `spec.versions` in the CRDs to declare `{ApiVersion}` as the _storage_ API version.
The command also updates custom resources so they are stored under `{ApiVersion}`.
New custom resource instances are created from the specification of the storage API version, so only one API version is ever marked as the storage version.

When you have upgraded the CRDs to use `{ApiVersion}` as the storage version, you should only use `{ApiVersion}` properties in your custom resources.

.Prerequisites

* A Cluster Operator supporting the `{ApiVersion}` API version is up and running.
* The API conversion tool, which is provided with the release artifacts.
* The tool requires Java 11 (OpenJDK).
* Custom resources have been converted to `{ApiVersion}`.
* The steps require a user admin account with RBAC permission to:
** List the Strimzi custom resources in all namespaces
** Replace the Strimzi custom resources being converted
** Update CRDs
** Replace the status of the CRDs

Use the CLI help for more information on the API conversion tool:

[source,shell]
----
bin/api-conversion.sh help

Use `bin/api-conversion.cmd` for this procedure if you are using Windows.

.Procedure

. If you have not done so, convert your custom resources to use `{ApiVersion}`.
+
You can use the API conversion tool to do this in one of two ways:
+
* xref:proc-upgrade-cli-tool-files-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-cli-tool-direct-{context}[]
+
Or you can make the changes manually.

. Run the API conversion tool with the `crd-upgrade` command.
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/api-conversion.sh crd-upgrade
----

. Verify that the CRDs have been upgraded so that {ApiVersion} is the storage version.
+
For example, for the Kafka topic CRD:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: kafkatopics.kafka.strimzi.io
  #...
spec:
  group: kafka.strimzi.io
  #...
  versions:
  - name: {ApiVersion}
    served: true
    storage: true
