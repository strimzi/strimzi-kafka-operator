[id='assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-{context}']
= Kafka cluster configuration

:context: deployment-configuration-kafka

The full schema of the `Kafka` resource is described in the xref:type-Kafka-reference[].
All labels that are applied to the desired `Kafka` resource will also be applied to the {ProductPlatformName} resources making up the Kafka cluster.
This provides a convenient mechanism for those resources to be labelled in whatever way the user requires.
