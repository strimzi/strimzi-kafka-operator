= Extending Kafka Connect with connector plug-ins

The {ProductName} container images for Kafka Connect include the two built-in file connectors: `FileStreamSourceConnector` and `FileStreamSinkConnector`.
You can add your own connectors by:

* Creating a container image from the Kafka Connect base image (manually or using your CI (continuous integration), for example).
* Creating a container image using OpenShift builds and Source-to-Image (S2I) - available only on OpenShift.
