= Kafka and Zookeeper storage types

As stateful applications, Kafka and Zookeeper need to store data on disk. {ProductName} supports three storage types for this data:

* Ephemeral
* Persistent
* JBOD storage

NOTE: JBOD storage is supported only for Kafka, not for Zookeeper.

When configuring a `Kafka` resource, you can specify the type of storage used by the Kafka broker and its corresponding Zookeeper node. You configure the storage type using the `storage` property in the following resources:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka`
* `Kafka.spec.zookeeper`

The storage type is configured in the `type` field.

WARNING: The storage type cannot be changed after a Kafka cluster is deployed.
