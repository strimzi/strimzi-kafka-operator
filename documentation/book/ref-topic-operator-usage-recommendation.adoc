= Topic Operator usage recommendations

When working with topics, be consistent and always operate on either `KafkaTopic` resources or topics directly. Avoid routinely switching between both methods for a given topic.

Use topic names that reflect the nature of the topic, and remember that names cannot be changed later.

If creating a topic in Kafka, use a name that is a valid {KubernetesName} resource name, otherwise the Topic Operator will need to create the corresponding `KafkaTopic` with a name that conforms to the {KubernetesName} rules.

NOTE: Recommendations for identifiers and names in {KubernetesName} are outlined in link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/identifiers.md[Identifiers and Names in Kubernetes^] community article.

.Kafka topic naming conventions

Kafka and {KubernetesName} impose their own validation rules for the naming of topics in Kafka and `KafkaTopic.metadata.name` respectively.
There are valid names for each which are invalid in the other.

Using the `spec.topicName property`, it is possible to create a valid topic in Kafka with a name that would be invalid for the KafkaTopic in {ProductPlatformName}.

The `spec.topicName` property inherits Kafka naming validation rules:

* The name must not be longer than 249 characters.
* Valid characters for Kafka topics are ASCII alphanumerics, `.`, `_`, and `-`.
* The name cannot be `.` or `..`, though `.` can be used in a name, such as `exampleTopic.` or `.exampleTopic`.

`spec.topicName` must not be changed.

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: topic-name-1
spec:
  topicName: topicName-1 # Upper case is invalid in {KubernetesName}
  # ...
----

cannot be changed to

[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: topic-name-1
spec:
  topicName: name-2
  # ...
----

NOTE: Some Kafka client applications, such as Kafka Streams, can create topics in Kafka programmatically. If those topics have names that are invalid {KubernetesName} resource names, the Topic Operator gives them valid names based on the Kafka names. Invalid characters are replaced and a hash is appended to the name.
