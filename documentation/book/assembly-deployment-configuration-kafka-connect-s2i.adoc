= Kafka Connect cluster with Source2Image support

:context: deployment-configuration-kafka-connect-s2i

The full schema of the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaConnectS2I-reference[].
All labels that are applied to the desired `KafkaConnectS2I` resource will also be applied to the {ProductPlatformName} resources making up the Kafka Connect cluster with Source2Image support.
This provides a convenient mechanism for those resources to be labelled in whatever way the user requires.
