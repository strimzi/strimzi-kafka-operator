= Upgrading brokers to a newer Kafka version

This procedure will describe how to upgrade a {ProductName} Kafka cluster from one version to a higher version, for example 2.0.0 to 2.1.0.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator which supports both versions of Kafka is up and running.
* A `Kafka` resource to be upgraded.
* You have checked that your `Kafka.spec.kafka.config` contains no options which are not supported in the version of Kafka being upgraded to.

.Procedure

. Ensure the `Kafka.spec.kafka.config` has the `log.message.format.version` configured to the default for the version being upgraded _from_.
For example, if upgrading from 2.0.0:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
spec:
  # ...
  kafka:
    version: 2.0.0
    config:
      log.message.format.version=2.0
      # ...
----
+
If this config is unset then set it and wait for the resulting rolling restart of the Kafka cluster to complete.

. Change the `Kafka.spec.kafka.version` to specify the version being upgraded _to_.
If the image to be used is different from the image for the given version of Kafka configured in the Cluster Operator's
`STRIMZI_KAFKA_IMAGES` then configure the `Kafka.spec.kafka.image`.
For example, if upgrading from Kafka 2.0.0 to 2.1.0:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
spec:
  # ...
  kafka:
    version: 2.1.0
    config:
      log.message.format.version: "2.0"
      # ...
----
+
NOTE: It is necessary to format the value of `log.message.format.version` as a string to prevent it being interpreted as a number.

. Wait for the Cluster Operator to upgrade the cluster, by inspecting the Cluster Operator logs and looking for a `INFO` level message like:
`Reconciliation #_<num>_(watch) Kafka(_<namespace>_/_<name>_): Kafka version upgrade from _<from-version>_ to _<to-version>_, phase 2 of 2 completed` (if two rolling updates were required), or
`Reconciliation #_<num>_(watch) Kafka(_<namespace>_/_<name>_): Kafka version upgrade from _<from-version>_ to _<to-version>_, phase 1 of 1 completed` (if a single rolling update was required).
For example, using `grep`:
+
[shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc logs -f _<cluster-operator-pod-name>_ | grep -E "Kafka version upgrade from [0-9.]+ to [0-9.]+, phase ([0-9]+) of \1 completed"
----

. Upgrade each client application to use the new version of the client libraries.
+
NOTE: If, for whatever reason, you need to revert the update at this point, follow the procedure xref:proc-downgradings-brokers-older-kafka-{context}[]. 
You will not be able to downgrade after this step.

. Change the `log.message.format.version` in `Kafka.spec.kafka.config` to the default version for the new version of Kafka now being used.
For example, if upgrading to 2.1.0:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
spec:
  # ...
  kafka:
    version: 2.1.0
    config:
      log.message.format.version: "2.1"
      # ...
----

. Wait for the Cluster Operator to update the cluster
