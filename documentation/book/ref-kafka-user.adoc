= Kafka User resource

The `KafkaUser` resource is used to declare a user with its authentication mechanism, authorization mechanism, and access rights.

== Authentication

Authentication is configured using the `authentication` property in `KafkaUser.spec`.
The authentication mechanism enabled for this user will be specified using the `type` field.
Currently, the only supported authentication mechanism is the TLS Client Authentication mechanism.

When no authentication mechanism is specified, User Operator will not create the user or its credentials.

=== TLS Client Authentication

To use TLS client authentication, set the `type` field to `tls`.

apiVersion: {KafkaUserApiVersion}
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
  # ...
----

When the user is created by the User Operator, it will create a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret will contain a public and private key which should be used for the TLS Client Authentication.
Bundled with them will be the public key of the client certification authority which was used to sign the user certificate.
All keys will be in X509 format.

  user.crt: # Public key of the user
  user.key: # Private key of the user
----

== Authorization

Authorization is configured using the `authorization` property in `KafkaUser.spec`.
The authorization type enabled for this user will be specified using the `type` field.
Currently, the only supported authorization type is the Simple authorization.

When no authorization is specified, the User Operator will not provision any access rights for the user.

=== Simple Authorization

To use Simple Authorization, set the `type` property to `simple`.
Simple authorization is using the `SimpleAclAuthorizer` plugin.
`SimpleAclAuthorizer` is the default authorization plugin which is part of Apache Kafka.
Simple Authorization allows you to specify list of ACL rules in the `acls` property.

The `acls` property should contain a list of `AclRule` objects.
`AclRule` specifies the access rights whcih will be granted to the user.
The `AclRule` object contains following properties:

`type`::
Specifies the type of the ACL rule.
The type can be either `allow` or `deny`.
The `type` field is optional and when not specified, the ACL rule will be treated as `allow` rule.

`operation`:: Specifies the operation which will be allowed or denied.
Following operations are supported:
+
* Read
* Write
* Delete
* Alter
* Describe
* All
* IdempotentWrite
* ClusterAction
* Create
* AlterConfigs
* DescribeConfigs
+
NOTE: Not every operation can be combined with every resource.

`host`:: Specifies a remote host from which is the rule allowed or denied.
Use `\*` to allow or deny the operation from all hosts.
The `host` field is optional and when not specified, the value `*` will be used as default.

`resource`:: Specifies the resource for which does the rule apply.
Simple Authorization supports 3 different resource types:
+
* Topics
* Consumer Groups
* Clusters
+
The resource type can be specified in the `type` property.
Use `topic` for Topics, `group` for Consumer Groups and `cluster` for clusters.
+
Topic and Group resources additionally allow to specify the name of the resource for which the rule applies.
The name can be specified in the `name` property.
The name can be either specified as literal or as a prefix.
To specify the name as literal, set the `patternType` property to the value `literal`.
Literal names will be taken exactly as they are specified in the `name` field.
To specify the name as a prefix, set the `patternType` property to the value `prefix`.
Prefix type names will use the value from the `name` only a prefix and will apply the rule to all resources with names starting with the value.
The cluster type resources have no name.
