= Deploying the User Operator standalone

Deploying the User Operator as a standalone component is more complicated than installing it using the Cluster Operator, but is more flexible.
For instance is can operate _with_ any Kafka cluster, not necessarily one deployed by the Cluster Operator.

.Prerequisites

* An existing Kafka cluster for the User Operator to connect to.

.Procedure

. Edit the `examples/install/user-operator/05-Deployment-strimzi-user-operator.yaml` resource. You will need to change the following
+
.. The `STRIMZI_CA_NAME` environment variable in `Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` should be set to point to an {ProductPlatformName} Secret which should contain the Cetificate Authority for signing new user certificates for TLS Client Authentication.
The secret should contain the public key of the certificate authority under the key `clients-ca.crt` and the private key under `clients-ca.key`.
.. The `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT` environment variable in `Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` should be set to a list of the Zookeeper nodes, given as a comma-separated list of `_<hostname>_:‍_<port>_` pairs. This should be the same Zookeeper cluster that your Kafka cluster is using.
.. The `STRIMZI_NAMESPACE` environment variable in `Deployment.spec.template.spec.containers[0].env` should be set to the {ProductPlatformName} namespace in which you want the operator to watch for  `KafkaUser` resources.

. Deploy the Cluster Operator.

ifdef::Kubernetes[]
On {KubernetesName} this can be done using `kubectl apply`:
+
[source,shell]
kubectl apply -f examples/install/user-operator
+
endif::Kubernetes[]
On {OpenShiftName} this can be done using `oc apply`:
+
[source,shell]
oc apply -f examples/install/user-operator

. Verify that the User Operator has been deployed successfully.
ifdef::Kubernetes[]
+
On {KubernetesName} this can be done using `kubectl describe`:
+
[source,shell]
kubectl describe deployment strimzi-user-operator
+
endif::Kubernetes[]
On {OpenShiftName} this can be done using `oc describe`:
+
[source,shell]
oc describe deployment strimzi-user-operator
+ 
The User Operator is deployed once the `Replicas:` entry shows `1 available`.
+
NOTE: This could take some time if you have a slow connection to the {ProductPlatformName} and the images have not been downloaded before.
