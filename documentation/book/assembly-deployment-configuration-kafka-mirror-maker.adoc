:context: deployment-configuration-kafka-mirror-maker

This chapter describes how to configure the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource to support a Kafka Mirror Maker deployment in your cluster.

Procedures show how the resource is configured:

* xref:configuring-kafka-bridge-{context}[Configuring Kafka Mirror Maker]
* xref:assembly-access-configuration-kafka-mirror-maker-{context}[Configuring Kafka Mirror Maker access control]

Supported properties are also described in more detail for your reference:

* xref:con-configuring-mirror-maker-{context}[Kafka Mirror Maker configuration properties]

The full schema of the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaMirrorMaker-reference[KafkaMirrorMaker schema reference].

NOTE: Labels applied to a `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources comprising Kafka Mirror Maker.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.
