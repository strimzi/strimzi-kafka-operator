= Topic Operator

The Topic Operator provides a way of managing topics in a Kafka cluster via {ProductPlatformName} resources.
//  The Topic Operator is deployed as a process running inside a {ProductPlatformName} cluster.
// It can be deployed through the Cluster Operator or "manually" through provided YAML files.

The role of the Topic Operator is to keep a set of `KafkaTopic` {ProductPlatformName} resources describing Kafka topics in-sync with corresponding Kafka topics.

Specifically:
 
* if a `KafkaTopic` is created, the operator will create the topic it describes
* if a `KafkaTopic` is deleted, the operator will delete the topic it describes
* if a `KafkaTopic` is changed, the operator will update the topic it describes

And also, in the other direction:

* if a topic is created within the Kafka cluster, the operator will create a `KafkaTopic` describing it
* if a topic is deleted from the Kafka cluster, the operator will create the `KafkaTopic` describing it
* if a topic in the Kafka cluster is changed, the operator will update the `KafkaTopic` describing it

This is beneficial to a {ProductPlatformName}-centric style of deploying applications, because it allows you to declare a `KafkaTopic` as part of your application's deployment and the operator will take care of creating the topic for you. 
Your application just needs to deal with producing or consuming from the necessary topics.

Should the topic be reconfigured, reassigned to different Kafka nodes and so on, 
the `KafkaTopic` will always be up to date.
