= Topic Operator environment

When deployed standalone the Topic Operator can be configured using environment variables.

NOTE: The Topic Operator should be configured using the `Kafka.spec.entityOperator.topicOperator` property when deployed by the Cluster Operator.

`STRIMZI_RESOURCE_LABELS`::
The label selector used to identify `KafkaTopics` to be managed by the operator.
`STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`::
The Zookeeper session timeout, in milliseconds.
For example, `10000`.
Default: `20000` (20 seconds).
`STRIMZI_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`::
The list of Kafka bootstrap servers.
This variable is mandatory.
`STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT`::
The Zookeeper connection information.
This variable is mandatory.
`STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations, in milliseconds.
`STRIMZI_TOPIC_METADATA_MAX_ATTEMPTS`::
The number of attempts for getting topics metadata from Kafka.
The time between each attempt is defined as an exponential back-off.
You might want to increase this value when topic creation could take more time due to its larger size (that is, many partitions/replicas).
Default `6`.
`STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL`::
The level for printing logging messages.
The value can be set to: `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, and `TRACE`.
Default `INFO`.
`STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED`::
For enabling the TLS support so encrypting the communication with Kafka brokers.
Default `true`.
`STRIMZI_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`::
The path to the truststore containing certificates for enabling TLS based communication.
This variable is mandatory only if TLS is enabled through `STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED`.
`STRIMZI_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD`::
The password for accessing the truststore defined by `STRIMZI_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`.
This variable is mandatory only if TLS is enabled through `STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED`.
`STRIMZI_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`::
The path to the keystore containing private keys for enabling TLS based communication.
This variable is mandatory only if TLS is enabled through `STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED`.
`STRIMZI_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`::
The password for accessing the keystore defined by `STRIMZI_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`.
This variable is mandatory only if TLS is enabled through `STRIMZI_TLS_ENABLED`.
