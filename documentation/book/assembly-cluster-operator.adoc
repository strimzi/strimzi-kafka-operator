[id='deploying-cluster-operator-{context}']
= Deploying the Cluster Operator

{ProductName} uses the Cluster Operator to deploy and manage Kafka (including Zookeeper) and Kafka Connect clusters.
The Cluster Operator is deployed inside of the
ifdef::Kubernetes[Kubernetes or]
OpenShift cluster.
To deploy a Kafka cluster, a `Kafka` resource with the cluster configuration has to be created within the
ifdef::Kubernetes[Kubernetes or]
OpenShift cluster.
Based on what is declared inside of the `Kafka` resource, the Cluster Operator deploys a corresponding Kafka cluster.
The format of the `Kafka` resource is described in xref:kafka_assembly_details[Format of the `Kafka` resource].

NOTE: {ProductName} contains example YAML files, which make deploying a Cluster Operator easier.
