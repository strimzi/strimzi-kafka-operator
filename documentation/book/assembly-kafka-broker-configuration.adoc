= Kafka broker configuration

{ProductName} allows you to customize the configuration of Apache Kafka brokers.
You can specify and configure most of the options listed in {ApachaKafkaBrokerConfig}.

The only options which cannot be configured are those related to the following areas:

* Security (Encryption, Authentication, and Authorization)
* Listener configuration
* Broker ID configuration
* Configuration of log data directories
* Inter-broker communication
* Zookeeper connectivity

These options are automatically configured by {ProductName}.
