= Kafka Connect configuration

{ProductName} allows you to customize the configuration of Apache Kafka Connect nodes by editing most of the options listed in {ApachaKafkaConnectConfig}.

The only options which cannot be configured are those related to the following areas:

* Kafka cluster bootstrap address
* Security (Encryption, Authentication, and Authorization)
* Listener / REST interface configuration
* Plugin path configuration

These options are automatically configured by {ProductName}.
