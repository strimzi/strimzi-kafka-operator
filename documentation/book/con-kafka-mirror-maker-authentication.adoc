= Authentication support in Kafka Mirror Maker

Authentication can be configured in the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.consumer.authentication` and `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.producer.authentication` properties.
The `authentication` property specifies the type of the authentication method which should be used and additional configuration details depending on the mechanism.
The currently supported authentication types are:

* TLS client authentication
* SASL based authentication using SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism


== TLS Client Authentication

To use the TLS client authentication, set the `type` property to the value `tls`.
The TLS client authentication uses TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate has to be specified in the certificateAndKey property.
It is always loaded from an {ProductPlatformName} secret.
Inside the secret, it has to be stored in the X.509 format separately as public and private keys.

NOTE: TLS client authentication can be used only with TLS connections.
For more details about TLS configuration in Kafka Mirror Maker see xref:assembly-kafka-mirror-maker-tls-{context}[].

== SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

To use the authentication using the SCRAM-SHA-512 SASL mechanism, set the `type` property to the value `scram-sha-512`.
It is possible to use it only if the broker listener, clients are connecting to, is configured to use it.
SCRAM-SHA-512 uses a username and password to authenticate.
Specify the username in the `username` property.
Specify the password as a link to a `Secret` containing the password in the `passwordSecret` property.
It has to specify the name of the `Secret` containing the password and the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.
