= Connecting to Zookeeper from a terminal
Open a terminal inside a Kafka container to use Kafka CLI tools that require a Zookeeper connection.

.Prerequisites

* An {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available.
* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Open the terminal using the {ProductPlatformName} console or run the `exec` command from your CLI.
+
For example:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{cmdcli} exec -ti _my-cluster_-kafka-0 -- bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
----
+
Be sure to use `localhost:2181`.
+
You can now run Kafaka commands to Zookeeper.
