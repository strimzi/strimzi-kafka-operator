= Labels and Annotations

For every resource, you can configure additional `Labels` and `Annotations`.
`Labels` and `Annotations` are used to identify and organize resources, and are configured in the `metadata` property.

For example:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
template:
    statefulset:
        metadata:
            labels:
                label1: value1
                label2: value2
            annotations:
                annotation1: value1
                annotation2: value2
# ...
----

The `labels` and `annotations` fields can contain any labels or annotations that do not contain the reserved string `strimzi.io`.
Labels and annotations containing `strimzi.io` are used internally by {ProductName} and cannot be configured.

It should be noted that the `metadata` data field and therefore the `label` and `annotations` fields are not applicable to container templates such as the `kafkaContainer`.
