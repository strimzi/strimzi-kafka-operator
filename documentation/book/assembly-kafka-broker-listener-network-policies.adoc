= Network policies

{ProductName} automatically creates a `NetworkPolicy` resource for every listener that is enabled on a Kafka broker.
By default, a `NetworkPolicy` grants access to a listener to all applications and namespaces.

If you want to restrict access to a listener to only selected applications or namespaces, use the `networkPolicyPeers` field.
Each listener can have a different `networkPolicyPeers` configuration.
