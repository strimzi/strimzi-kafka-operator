= Configuring clients to trust the cluster CA

If a Kafka client wants to connect to the `tls` listener on port 9093 or the `external` listener on port 9094, it needs to trust the cluster CA certificate.

.Procedure

. The cluster CA certificate can be extracted from the generated `_cluster-name_-cluster-ca-cert` `Secret`.
ifdef::Kubernetes[]
+
On {KubernetesName}, the certificate can be extracted with the following command:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
kubectl get secret _cluster-name_-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt
endif::Kubernetes[]
+
On {OpenShiftName}, the certificate can be extracted with the following command:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
oc extract secret/_cluster-name_-cluster-ca-cert --keys ca.crt

. The Kafka client has to be configured to trust certificates signed by this CA.
For the Java-based Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams APIs, you can do this by importing the CA certificate into the JVM's truststore using the following `keytool` command:
+
[source,shell]
keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca.crt

. In order to configure the Kafka client, following properties should be specified:

* `security.protocol: SSL` when using TLS for encryption (with or without TLS authentication), or `security.protocol: SASL_SSL` when using SCRAM-SHA authentication over TLS.
* `ssl.truststore.location`: the truststore location where the certificates were imported.
* `ssl.truststore.password`: the password for accessing the truststore. This property can be omitted if it is not needed by the truststore.
