= Downgrading brokers to an older Kafka version

This procedure will describe how to downgrade a {ProductName} Kafka cluster from one version to a lower version, for example 2.1.0 to 2.0.0.

IMPORTANT: Downgrading is not possible if the version being downgraded _from_ has ever used a `log.message.format.version` that's not supported by the version being downgraded _to_. 
For example if a 2.1.0 cluster has _always_ been configured with `log.message.format.version=2.0` then downgrading to 2.0 is possible, but downgrading to 1.1.0 is not possible.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator up and running.
* A `Kafka` resource to be downgraded.
* The `Kafka.spec.kafka.config` has a `log.message.format.version` that is supported by the version being downgraded to.
* You have checked that your `Kafka.spec.kafka.config` contains no options which are not supported in the version of Kafka being downgraded to.

.Procedure

. Change the `Kafka.spec.kafka.version` to specify the version being upgraded _to_.
If the image to be used is different from the image for the given version of Kafka configured in the Cluster Operator's
`STRIMZI_KAFKA_IMAGES` then configure the `Kafka.spec.kafka.image`.
For example, if downgrading from Kafka 2.1.0 to 2.0.0:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
spec:
  # ...
  kafka:
    version: 2.0.0
    config:
      log.message.format.version=2.0
      # ...
----

. Wait for the Cluster Operator to downgrade the cluster, by inspecting the Cluster Operator logs and looking for a `INFO` level message like:
`Reconciliation #_<num>_(watch) Kafka(_<namespace>_/_<name>_): Kafka version downgrade from _<from-version>_ to _<to-version>_, phase 2 of 2 completed` (if two rolling updates were required), or
`Reconciliation #_<num>_(watch) Kafka(_<namespace>_/_<name>_): Kafka version downgrade from _<from-version>_ to _<to-version>_, phase 1 of 1 completed` (if a single rolling update was required).
For example, using `grep`:
+
[shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
oc logs -f _<cluster-operator-pod-name>_ | grep -E "Kafka version downgrade from [0-9.]+ to [0-9.]+, phase ([0-9]+) of \1 completed"
----



. Downgrade each client application to use the old version of the client libraries.
