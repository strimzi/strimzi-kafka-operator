= FIPS support

[role="_abstract"]
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are standards for computer security and interoperability.
When running Strimzi on a FIPS-enabled Kubernetes cluster, the OpenJDK used in Strimzi container images automatically switches to FIPS mode.
From version 0.33, Strimzi can run on FIPS-enabled Kubernetes clusters without any changes or special configuration.
It uses only the FIPS-compliant security libraries from the OpenJDK.

.Minimum password length
When running in the FIPS mode, SCRAM-SHA-512 passwords need to be at least 32 characters long.
From Strimzi 0.33, the default password length in Strimzi User Operator is set to 32 characters as well.
If you have a Kafka cluster with custom configuration that uses a password length that is less than 32 characters, you need to update your configuration.
If you have any users with passwords shorter than 32 characters, you need to regenerate a password with the required length.
You can do that, for example, by deleting the user secret and waiting for the User Operator to create a new password with the appropriate length.
