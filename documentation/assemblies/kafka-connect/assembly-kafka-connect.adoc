= Kafka Connect cluster configuration (plus S2I option)

This section describes how to configure a Kafka Connect deployment in your Strimzi cluster.

Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems using `Connector` plugins.
Kafka Connect provides a framework for integrating Kafka with an external data source or target, such as a database, for import or export of data using connectors.
Connectors are plugins that provide the connection configuration needed.

If you are using Kafka Connect, you configure either the `KafkaConnect` and `KafkaConnectS2I` resource.
Use the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource if you are using the {docs-okd-s2i} framework to deploy Kafka Connect.

* The full schema of the `KafkaConnect` resource is described in xref:type-KafkaConnect-reference[].
* The full schema of the `KafkaConnectS2I` resource is described in xref:type-KafkaConnectS2I-reference[].
