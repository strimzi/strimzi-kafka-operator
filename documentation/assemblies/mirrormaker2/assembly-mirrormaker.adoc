= Using {ProductName} with MirrorMaker 2.0.

This section describes using {ProductName} with MirrorMaker 2.0.

MirrorMaker 2.0 is used to replicate data between two or more active Kafka clusters, within or across data centers.

Data replication across clusters supports scenarios that require:

* Recovery of data in the event of a system failure
* Aggregation of data for analysis
* Restriction of data access to a specific cluster
* Provision of data at a specific location to improve latency

NOTE: MirrorMaker 2.0 has features not supported by the previous version of MirrorMaker.
