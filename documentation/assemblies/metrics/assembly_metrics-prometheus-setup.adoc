= Using Prometheus with Strimzi

[role="_abstract"]
You can use Prometheus to provide monitoring data for the example Grafana dashboards provided with Strimzi.

To expose metrics in Prometheus format, you add configuration to a custom resource.
You must also make sure that the metrics are scraped by your monitoring stack.
Prometheus and Prometheus Alertmanager are used in the examples provided by Strimzi, but you can use also other compatible tools.

You can expose metrics using one of the following approaches:

* xref:proc-jmx-exporter-metrics-kafka-deploy-options-{context}[Enabling Prometheus JMX Exporter]

* xref:proc-metrics-reporter-kafka-deploy-options-{context}[Enabling Strimzi Metrics Reporter]

After enabling metrics, you can integrate with Prometheus:

. xref:assembly-metrics-prometheus-{context}[Setting up Prometheus]
. xref:proc-metrics-deploying-prometheus-alertmanager-{context}[Deploying Prometheus Alertmanager]

Strimzi provides an xref:assembly-metrics-config-files-str[example Grafana dashboards] to display visualizations of metrics.
The exposed metrics provide the monitoring data when you xref:proc-metrics-grafana-dashboard-str[enable the Grafana dashboard].
