= Introducing metrics to Kafka

[role="_abstract"]
You can use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Strimzi deployment.

Depending on your requirements, you can:

* xref:assembly-metrics-setup-{context}[Set up and deploy Prometheus to expose metrics]
* xref:proc-metrics-kafka-deploy-options-{context}[Deploy Kafka Exporter to provide additional metrics]
* xref:proc-metrics-grafana-dashboard-{context}[Use Grafana to present the Prometheus metrics]

With Prometheus and Grafana set up, you can use the example Grafana dashboards provided by Strimzi for monitoring.

Additionally, you can configure your deployment to track messages end-to-end by link:{BookURLUsing}#assembly-distributed-tracing-str[setting up distributed tracing^].

NOTE: Strimzi provides example installation files for Prometheus and Grafana.
You can use these files as a starting point when trying out monitoring of Strimzi.
For further support, try engaging with the Prometheus and Grafana developer communities.
