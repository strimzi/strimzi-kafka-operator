= Introducing metrics

[role="_abstract"]
You can use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Strimzi deployment.

You can monitor your Strimzi deployment by viewing key metrics on dashboards and setting up alerts that trigger under certain conditions.
Metrics are available for each of the components of Strimzi.

You can also collect metrics specific to `oauth` authentication and `opa` or `keycloak` authorization. 
You do this by setting the `enableMetrics` property to `true` in the listener configuration of the `Kafka` resource. 
For example, set `enableMetrics`  to `true` in `spec.kafka.listeners.authentication` and `spec.kafka.authorization`.
Similarly, you can enable metrics for `oauth` authentication in the `KafkaBridge`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resources.  

To provide metrics information, Strimzi uses Prometheus rules and Grafana dashboards.

When configured with a set of rules for each component of Strimzi, Prometheus consumes key metrics from the pods that are running in your cluster.
Grafana then visualizes those metrics on dashboards.
Strimzi includes example Grafana dashboards that you can customize to suit your deployment.

Depending on your requirements, you can:

* xref:assembly-metrics-setup-{context}[Set up and deploy Prometheus to expose metrics]
* xref:proc-metrics-kafka-deploy-options-{context}[Deploy Kafka Exporter to provide additional metrics]
* xref:proc-metrics-grafana-dashboard-{context}[Use Grafana to present the Prometheus metrics]

With Prometheus and Grafana set up, you can use the example Grafana dashboards provided by Strimzi for monitoring.

Additionally, you can configure your deployment to track messages end-to-end by xref:assembly-distributed-tracing-str[setting up distributed tracing].

NOTE: Strimzi provides example installation files for Prometheus and Grafana.
You can use these files as a starting point when trying out monitoring of Strimzi.
For further support, try engaging with the Prometheus and Grafana developer communities.
