= Using {oauth} token based authentication

{ProductName} supports the use of {oauth} authentication using the _SASL OAUTHBEARER_ mechanism.

{oauth} enables standardized token based authentication and authorization between applications, using a central authorization server to issue tokens that grant limited access to resources.

In {ProductName}, {oauth} is currently only supported for authentication, with no authorization support.
However, {oauth} authentication can be used in conjunction with xref:simple-acl-using-uo[ACL-based Kafka authorization].

Using {oauth} token based authentication, application clients can access resources on application servers (called ‘resource servers’) without exposing account credentials.
The client passes an access token as a means of authenticating, which application servers can also use to ascertain the level of access granted.
The authorization server handles the granting of access and inquiries about access.

In the context of {ProductName}:

* Kafka brokers act as resource servers
* Kafka clients act as resource clients

The brokers are the servers to which the clients authenticate.
The brokers and clients communicate with the {oauth} authorization server, as necessary, to obtain or validate access tokens.

For a deployment of {ProductName}, {oauth} integration provides:

* Server-side {oauth} support for Kafka brokers
* Client-side {oauth} support for Kafka Mirror Maker, Kafka Connect and the Kafka Bridge
