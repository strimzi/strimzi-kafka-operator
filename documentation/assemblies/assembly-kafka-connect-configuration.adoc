= Kafka Connect configuration

Strimzi allows you to customize the configuration of Apache Kafka Connect nodes by editing certain options listed in {ApacheKafkaConnectConfig}.

Configuration options that cannot be configured relate to:

* Kafka cluster bootstrap address
* Security (Encryption, Authentication, and Authorization)
* Listener / REST interface configuration
* Plugin path configuration

These options are automatically configured by Strimzi.
