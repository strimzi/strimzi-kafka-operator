= Downgrading Strimzi

[role="_abstract"]
If you are encountering issues with the version of Strimzi you upgraded to,
you can revert your installation to the previous version.

If you used the YAML installation files to install Strimzi, you can use the YAML installation files from the previous release to perform the following downgrade procedures:

. xref:proc-downgrade-cluster-operator-{context}[]
. xref:assembly-downgrade-kafka-versions-{context}[]

If the previous version of Strimzi does not support the version of Kafka you are using,
you can also downgrade Kafka as long as the log message format versions appended to messages match.

WARNING: If you deployed Strimzi using another installation method, use a supported approach to downgrade Strimzi.
Do not use the downgrade instructions provided here. 
For example, if you installed Strimzi using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), you can downgrade by changing the deployment channel to an earlier version of Strimzi.
