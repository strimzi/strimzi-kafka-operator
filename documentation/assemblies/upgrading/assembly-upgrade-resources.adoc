= Strimzi custom resource upgrades

[role="_abstract"]
After you have upgraded Strimzi to {ProductVersion}, you must ensure that your custom resources are using API version `{ApiVersion}`.
You can do this any time after upgrading to {ProductVersion}, but the upgrades must be completed before the next Strimzi minor version update.

IMPORTANT: Upgrade of the custom resources to `{ApiVersion}` _must_ be performed after xref:assembly-upgrade-{context}[upgrading the Cluster Operator], so the Cluster Operator can understand the resources.

NOTE: Upgrade of the custom resources to `{ApiVersion}` prepares Strimzi for a move to Kubernetes CRD `v1`,
which will be required for Kubernetes 1.22.

.CLI upgrades to custom resources

Strimzi provides an _API conversion tool_ with its release artifacts.

ifdef::Downloading[]
You can download its ZIP or TAR.GZ file from {ReleaseDownload}.
endif::Downloading[]
ifndef::Downloading[]
You can download its ZIP or TAR.GZ from {ZipDownload}.
endif::Downloading[]
To use the tool, extract it and use the scripts in the `bin` directory.

From its CLI, you can then use the tool to convert the format of your custom resources to `{ApiVersion}` in one of two ways:

* xref:proc-upgrade-cli-tool-files-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-cli-tool-direct-{context}[]

After the conversion of your custom resources, you must set `{ApiVersion}` as the _storage_ API version in your CRDs:

* xref:proc-upgrade-cli-tool-crds-{context}[]

.Manual upgrades to custom resources

Instead of using the API conversion tool to update custom resources to `{ApiVersion}`, you can manually update each custom resource to use `{ApiVersion}`:

Update the `Kafka` custom resource, including the configurations for the other components:

* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-zookeeper-api-version-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-topic-operator-api-version-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-entity-operator-api-version-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-cruise-control-api-version-{context}[] (if Cruise Control is deployed)
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-api-version-{context}[]

Update the other custom resources that apply to your deployment:

* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-connect-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-connect-s2i-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-mirror-maker-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-mirror-maker2-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-bridge-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-user-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-topic-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafkaconnector-resources-{context}[]
* xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-rebalance-resources-{context}[]

The manual procedures show the changes that are made to each custom resource.
After these changes, you must use the API conversion tool to upgrade your CRDs.
