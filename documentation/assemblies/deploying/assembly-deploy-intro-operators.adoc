= Strimzi operators

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi uses operators to deploy and manage Kafka components.
The operators continuously monitor Strimzi custom resources (like `Kafka`, `KafkaTopic`, and `KafkaUser`) and reconcile the state of Kafka components to match their configuration.

Strimzi provides the following operators, each responsible for different aspects of a Kafka deployment:

Cluster Operator (required):: The Cluster Operator is the core operator and must be deployed first. 
It handles the deployment and lifecycle of Apache Kafka clusters on Kubernetes, automating the setup of Kafka nodes and related resources.
+
Additionally, Strimzi provides *Drain Cleaner*, which is deployed separately.
Drain Cleaner supports the Cluster Operator in managing pod evictions for Kafka clusters.

Entity Operator (recommended):: The Entity Operator can be deployed by the Cluster Operator.
It runs in a single pod and includes one or both of the following operators:
+
--
* *Topic Operator* to manage Kafka topics.
* *User Operator* to manage Kafka users.
--
+
Each operator runs in a separate container within the Entity Operator pod.

ifdef::Section[]
Access Operator (optional):: Manages and shares Kafka cluster connection details.
It is deployed independently of the Cluster Operator.
endif::Section[]

NOTE: The Topic Operator and User Operator can also be deployed standalone (without the Entity Operator) to manage topics and users for a Kafka cluster that is not managed by Strimzi.
