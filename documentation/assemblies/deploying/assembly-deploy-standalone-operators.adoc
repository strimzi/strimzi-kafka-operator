[id="deploy-standalone-operators_{context}"]
= Alternative standalone deployment options for Strimzi operators

[role="_abstract"]
You can perform a standalone deployment of the Topic Operator and User Operator.
Consider a standalone deployment of these operators if you are using a Kafka cluster that is not managed by the Cluster Operator.

You deploy the operators to Kubernetes, Kafka can be running outside of Kubernetes.
For example, you might be using a managed Kafka service.

To connect the standalone operators to your Kafka cluster, you must set environment variables that specify the cluster address and authentication details. 
These variables are automatically configured when deploying the operators with the Cluster Operator.
