= Preparing for your Strimzi deployment

[role="_abstract"]
Prepare for a deployment of Strimzi by completing any necessary pre-deployment tasks. 
Take the necessary preparatory steps according to your specific requirements, such as the following:

* xref:deploy-prereqs-{context}[Ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites before deploying Strimzi]
* xref:downloads-{context}[Downloading the Strimzi release artifacts to facilitate your deployment]
* xref:container-images-{context}[Pushing the Strimzi container images into your own registry (if required)]
* xref:adding-users-the-strimzi-admin-role-{context}[Setting up admin roles to enable configuration of custom resources used in the deployment]
* xref:deploy-kubernetes-{context}[Considering _Minikube_ as an alternative deployment option to Kubernetes]

NOTE: To run the commands in this guide, your cluster user must have the rights to manage role-based access control (RBAC) and CRDs.
