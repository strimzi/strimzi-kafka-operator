= Setting up client access to the Kafka cluster

After you have xref:deploy-tasks_{context}[deployed Strimzi], the procedures in this section explain how to:

* Deploy example producer and consumer clients, which you can use to verify your deployment
* Set up external client access to the Kafka cluster
