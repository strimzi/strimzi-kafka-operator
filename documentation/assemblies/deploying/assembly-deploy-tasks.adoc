The steps to deploy Strimzi using the installation files are as follows:

. xref:cluster-operator-{context}[Deploy the Cluster Operator]

.. xref:deploying-the-user-operator-using-the-cluster-operator-{context}[User Operator]
. Optionally, deploy the following Kafka components according to your requirements:
* xref:kafka-connect-{context}[Kafka Connect]
* xref:kafka-mirror-maker-{context}[Kafka MirrorMaker]
* xref:http-bridge-{context}[Kafka Bridge]
