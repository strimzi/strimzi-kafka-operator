= Deploying Strimzi using installation artifacts

[role="_abstract"]
Having xref:deploy-tasks-prereqs_{context}[prepared your environment for a deployment of Strimzi], you can deploy Strimzi to a Kubernetes cluster.
Use the installation files provided with the release artifacts.

ifdef::Downloading[]
You can deploy Strimzi {ProductVersion} on Kubernetes {KubernetesVersion}.
endif::Downloading[]

ifndef::Downloading[]
Strimzi is based on {StrimziVersion}.
You can deploy Strimzi {ProductVersion} on OpenShift {OpenShiftVersion}.
endif::Downloading[]

The steps to deploy Strimzi using the installation files are as follows:

. xref:cluster-operator-{context}[Deploy the Cluster Operator]
. Use the Cluster Operator to deploy the following:
.. xref:kafka-cluster-{context}[Kafka cluster]
.. xref:deploying-the-topic-operator-using-the-cluster-operator-{context}[Topic Operator]
.. xref:deploying-the-user-operator-using-the-cluster-operator-{context}[User Operator]
. Optionally, deploy the following Kafka components according to your requirements:
* xref:kafka-connect-{context}[Kafka Connect]
* xref:kafka-mirror-maker-{context}[Kafka MirrorMaker]
* xref:kafka-bridge-{context}[Kafka Bridge]
