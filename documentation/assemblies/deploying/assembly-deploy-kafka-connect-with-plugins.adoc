= Adding Kafka Connect connectors

[role="_abstract"]
Kafka Connect uses connectors to integrate with other systems to stream data.
A connector is an instance of a Kafka `Connector` class, which can be one of the following type:

Source connector:: A source connector is a runtime entity that fetches data from an external system and feeds it to Kafka as messages.
Sink connector:: A sink connector is a runtime entity that fetches messages from Kafka topics and feeds them to an external system.

include::../../shared/snip-intro-connectors.adoc[]

Add connector plugins to Kafka Connect in one of the following ways:

* xref:creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-{context}[Configure Kafka Connect to build a new container image with plugins automatically]
* xref:creating-new-image-from-base-{context}[Create a Docker image from the base Kafka Connect image] (manually or using continuous integration)

After plugins have been added to the container image, you can start, stop, and manage connector instances in the following ways:

* xref:proc-deploying-kafkaconnector-{context}[Using Strimzi’s `KafkaConnector` custom resource]
* xref:con-exposing-kafka-connect-api-{context}[Using the Kafka Connect API] 

You can also create new connector instances using these options.
