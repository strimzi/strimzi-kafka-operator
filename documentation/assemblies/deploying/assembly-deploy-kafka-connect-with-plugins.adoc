The procedures in this section show how to add your own connector classes to connector images by:

* xref:creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-{context}[Creating a new container image automatically using Strimzi]

* xref:creating-new-image-from-base-{context}[Creating a container image from the Kafka Connect base image (manually or using continuous integration)]

IMPORTANT: You create the configuration for connectors directly xref:con-creating-managing-connectors-{context}[using the Kafka Connect REST API or KafkaConnector custom resources].
