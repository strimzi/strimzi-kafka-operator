= Managing secure access to Kafka

[role="_abstract"]
Secure your Kafka cluster by managing the access a client has to Kafka brokers.
Specify configuration options to secure Kafka brokers and clients

A secure connection between Kafka brokers and clients can encompass the following:

* Encryption for data exchange
* Authentication to prove identity
* Authorization to allow or decline actions executed by users

The authentication and authorization mechanisms specified for a client must match those specified for the Kafka brokers.
Strimzi operators automate the configuration process and create the certificates required for authentication.
