= Managing secure access to Kafka

You can secure your Kafka cluster by managing the access each client has to the Kafka brokers.

A secure connection between Kafka brokers and clients can encompass:

* Encryption for data exchange
* Authentication to prove identity
* Authorization to allow or decline actions executed by users

This chapter explains how to set up secure connections between Kafka brokers and clients, with sections describing:

* Security options for Kafka clusters and clients
* How to secure Kafka brokers
* How to use an authorization server for OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication and authorization
