= Strimzi operators

[role="_abstract"]
Operators are Kubernetes components that package, deploy, and manage applications by extending the Kubernetes API. 
They simplify administrative tasks and reduce manual intervention.

Strimzi provides a set of operators to automate the deployment and management of Apache Kafka on Kubernetes. 
Strimzi custom resources define the configuration for each deployment.

Strimzi includes the following operators:

Cluster Operator:: Manages Kafka clusters and related components
Topic Operator:: Creates, configures, and deletes Kafka topics
User Operator:: Manages Kafka users and their authentication credentials

The Cluster Operator can deploy the Entity Operator, which runs the Topic Operator and User Operator in a single pod. 
The Entity Operator can be configured to run one or both operators.

NOTE: The Entity Operator does not manage Kafka clusters. 
It simply runs the Topic Operator and User Operator in separate containers within its pod, allowing them to handle topic and user management.

For Kafka clusters not managed by Strimzi, the Topic Operator and User Operator can also be deployed standalone (without the Entity Operator).

Additionally, Strimzi provides Drain Cleaner, a separate tool that can be used alongside the Cluster Operator to assist with safe pod eviction during maintenance or upgrades.
