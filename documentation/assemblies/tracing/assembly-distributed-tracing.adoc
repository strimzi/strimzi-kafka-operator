= Introducing distributed tracing

Distributed tracing allows you to track the progress of transactions between applications in a distributed system. In a microservices architecture, tracing tracks the progress of transactions between services. Trace data is useful for monitoring application performance and investigating issues with target systems and end-user applications.

In Strimzi, tracing facilitates the end-to-end tracking of messages: from source systems to Kafka, and then from Kafka to target systems and applications. It complements the metrics that are available to view in link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-setup-{context}[Grafana dashboards], as well as the component loggers.

Support for tracing is built in to the following Kafka components:

* Kafka Connect
* MirrorMaker
* MirrorMaker 2.0
* Strimzi Kafka Bridge

Tracing is not supported for Kafka brokers.

You enable and configure tracing for these components through their custom resources. 
You enable tracing by specifying a tracing type using the `spec.tracing.type` property:

* `opentelemetry` for OpenTelemetry with the Jaeger Exporter
* `jaeger` for OpenTracing with Jaeger

You add tracing configuration using `spec.template` properties. 

[NOTE]
====
Support for `type: jaeger` tracing is deprecated.
The Jaeger clients are now retired and the OpenTracing project archived.
As such, we cannot guarantee their support for future Kafka versions.
====

To enable tracing in Kafka producers, consumers, and Kafka Streams API applications, you _instrument_ application code. 
When instrumented, clients generate trace data; for example, when producing messages or writing offsets to the log.

[NOTE]
====
Setting up tracing for applications and systems beyond Strimzi is outside the scope of this content.

== Outline of procedures

To set up tracing for Strimzi, follow these procedures in order:

* xref:proc-enabling-tracing-in-connect-mirror-maker-bridge-resources-{context}[Enable tracing for MirrorMaker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka Bridge]

* Set up tracing for clients:

** xref:proc-configuring-tracers-kafka-clients-{context}[Initialize a Jaeger tracer for Kafka clients]

* Instrument clients with tracers:

** xref:proc-instrumenting-producers-consumers-for-opentracing-{context}[Instrument producers and consumers for tracing]

** xref:proc-instrumenting-kafka-streams-with-tracers-{context}[Instrument Kafka Streams applications for tracing]

== Prerequisites

* The Jaeger backend components are deployed to your Kubernetes cluster. 
We recommend using the Jaeger operator for deploying Jaeger on your Kubernetes cluster.
For deployment instructions, see the {JaegerDocs}.
