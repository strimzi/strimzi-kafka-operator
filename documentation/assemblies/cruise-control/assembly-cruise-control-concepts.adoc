= Using Cruise Control for cluster rebalancing

[role="_abstract"]
Cruise Control is an open-source application designed to run alongside Kafka to help optimize use of cluster resources by doing the following:

* Monitoring cluster workload
* Rebalancing partitions based on predefined constraints

Cruise Control operations help with running a more balanced Kafka cluster that uses brokers more efficiently.

As Kafka clusters evolve, some brokers may become overloaded while others remain underutilized. 
Cruise Control addresses this imbalance by modeling resource utilization at the replica level--including, CPU, disk, network load--and generating optimization proposals (which you can approve or reject) for balanced partition assignments based on configurable optimization goals.

Optimization proposals are configured and generated using a `KafkaRebalance` resource. 
You can configure the resource using an annotation so that optimization proposals are approved automatically or manually.

NOTE: Strimzi provides xref:config-examples-{context}[example configuration files for Cruise Control].
