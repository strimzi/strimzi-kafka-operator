= Kafka Bridge quickstart

:context: kafka-bridge-quickstart

Use this quickstart to try out the Strimzi Kafka Bridge in your local development environment. You will learn how to:

* Deploy the Kafka Bridge to your Kubernetes cluster
* Expose the Kafka Bridge service to your local machine by using port-forwarding
* Produce messages to topics and partitions in your Kafka cluster
* Create a Kafka Bridge consumer
* Perform basic consumer operations, such as subscribing the consumer to topics and retrieving the messages that you produced

In this quickstart, HTTP requests are formatted as curl commands that you can copy and paste to your terminal. Access to a Kubernetes cluster is required.

Ensure you have the prerequisites and then follow the tasks in the order provided in this chapter.

.About data formats

In this quickstart, you will produce and consume messages in JSON format, not binary. For more information on the data formats and HTTP headers used in the example requests, see xref:con-requests-kafka-bridge-kafka-bridge-overview[].

.Prerequisites for the quickstart

* Cluster administrator access to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster.
* Strimzi is installed.
* A running Kafka cluster, deployed by the Cluster Operator, in a Kubernetes namespace.
* The Entity Operator is deployed and running as part of the Kafka cluster.
