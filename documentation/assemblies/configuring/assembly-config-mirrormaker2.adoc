= Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 cluster configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 deployment using the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource.
MirrorMaker 2.0 replicates data between two or more Kafka clusters, within or across data centers.

xref:type-KafkaMirrorMaker2-reference[] describes the full schema of the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource.

MirrorMaker 2.0 resource configuration differs from the previous version of MirrorMaker.
If you choose to use MirrorMaker 2.0, there is currently no legacy support, so any resources must be manually converted into the new format.
