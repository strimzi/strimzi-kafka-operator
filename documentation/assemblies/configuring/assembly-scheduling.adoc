= Configuring pod scheduling

[role="_abstract"]
To optimize the resilience and performance of your Kafka cluster, you can control how its pods are scheduled across Kubernetes nodes.
Pod scheduling strategies can help you to achieve the following:

* Increase fault tolerance by spreading Kafka pods across different nodes.
* Avoid resource contention by separating pods from critical workloads.
* Maintain resource availability by assigning Kafka pods to nodes with sufficient capacity.
