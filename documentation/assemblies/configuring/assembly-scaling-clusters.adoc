= Scaling clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Scale Kafka clusters by adding or removing brokers.
If a cluster already has topics defined, you also have to reassign partitions.

Use the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` tool to reassign partitions.
The tool uses a reassignment JSON file that specifies the topics to reassign.

You can generate a reassignment JSON file or create a file manually if you want to move specific partitions.
