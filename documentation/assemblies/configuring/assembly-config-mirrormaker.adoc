= Kafka MirrorMaker cluster configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a Kafka MirrorMaker deployment using the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource.
KafkaMirrorMaker replicates data between Kafka clusters.

xref:type-KafkaMirrorMaker-reference[] describes the full schema of the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource.

You can use Strimzi with MirrorMaker or xref:assembly-mirrormaker-str[MirrorMaker 2.0].
MirrorMaker 2.0 is the latest version, and offers a more efficient way to mirror data between Kafka clusters.

IMPORTANT: Kafka MirrorMaker 1 (referred to as just _MirrorMaker_ in the documentation) has been deprecated in Apache Kafka 3.0.0 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0.0.  
As a result, the `KafkaMirrorMaker` custom resource which is used to deploy Kafka MirrorMaker 1 has been deprecated in Strimzi as well.
The `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource will be removed from Strimzi when we adopt Apache Kafka 4.0.0.
As a replacement, use the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource with the xref:unidirectional_replication_activepassive[`IdentityReplicationPolicy`].
