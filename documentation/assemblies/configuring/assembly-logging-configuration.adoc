= Configuring logging levels

[role="_abstract"]

WARNING: Strimzi operators and Kafka components use log4j2 for logging.
However, Kafka 3.9 and earlier versions rely on log4j1.
For loggers and logging configuration examples based on log4j1, refer to the link:{DocArchive}[Strimzi 0.45 documentation^]. These examples can also be used with Strimzi 0.46 and Kafka 3.9.x.

Configure the logging levels of Kafka components and Strimzi operators through their custom resources.
You can use either of these options:

* Specify logging levels directly in the `spec.logging` property of the custom resource.
* Define logging properties in a custom `ConfigMap` and reference it using the `configMapKeyRef` property.

Advantages of using a `ConfigMap`:

* Centralized maintenance
* Reusable with multiple resources
* For operators, the flexibility to append logging specifications to add filters

Specify a logging `type` in your logging specification:

* `inline` when specifying logging levels directly
* `external` when referencing a `ConfigMap`

For `inline` configuration, use the `loggers` property to set the root logger level and levels for specific classes or loggers.

.Example inline logging configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ...
logging:
  type: inline
  loggers:
    rootLogger.level: INFO
# ...
----

Use a `ConfigMap` to define logging configurations using the `log4j2.properties` key. 
Set the logging `name` and `key` properties to reference the `ConfigMap`. 
Both properties are mandatory. 

.Example external logging configuration
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
# ...
logging:
  type: external
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: my-config-map
      key: log4j2.properties
# ...
----

Default logging is used if logging is not specified in the resource using either method.
Loggers that haven't been explicitly configured inherit settings from their parent loggers. 
By default, any available loggers that are not configured have their level set to `OFF`.

When a resource managed by the Cluster Operator is created, a `ConfigMap` with the specified logging configuration is also created. 
For components managed by the Strimzi operators, changes to logging levels are applied dynamically.

WARNING: Setting a log level to `DEBUG` may result in a large amount of log output and may have performance implications.

== Configurable loggers

The following Kafka components and operators have specific loggers available for configuration:

* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-kafka-logging-reference[Kafka loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-kafka-connect-logging-reference[Kafka Connect and MirrorMaker 2 loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-kafka-bridge-logging-reference[Kafka Bridge loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-cruise-control-logging-reference[Cruise Control loggers^]
* xref:ref-operator-cluster-logging-configmap-str[Cluster Operator loggers]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-topic-operator-logging-reference[Topic Operator loggers^]
* link:{BookURLConfiguring}#property-user-operator-logging-reference[User Operator loggers^]
