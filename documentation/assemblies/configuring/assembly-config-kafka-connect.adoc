= Kafka Connect cluster configuration

[role="_abstract"]
Configure a Kafka Connect deployment using the `KafkaConnect` resource.
Kafka Connect is an integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems using connector plugins.
Kafka Connect provides a framework for integrating Kafka with an external data source or target, such as a database, for import or export of data using connectors.
Connectors are plugins that provide the connection configuration needed.

xref:type-KafkaConnect-reference[] describes the full schema of the `KafkaConnect` resource.

For more information on deploying connector plugins, see link:{BookURLDeploying}#using-kafka-connect-with-plug-ins-str[Extending Kafka Connect with connector plugins^].
