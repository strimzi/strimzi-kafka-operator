= Strimzi Glossary

[role="_abstract"]
This glossary explains terminology unique to Strimzi and its components. 
It supports consistent usage and understanding across Strimzi documentation. 
Terms from Kafka and Kubernetes are outside its scope.

== A

=== Access Operator
[id="glossary-access-operator_{context}"]
An optional operator that simplifies the sharing of Kafka connection information and credentials between namespaces. 
Connection details are stored centrally in a `Secret` resource.

=== Authentication 
[id="glossary-authentication_{context}"]
Defines how clients prove their identity to the Kafka cluster. 
Strimzi manages authentication as a client-server relationship:

* *Server-Side*: The Kafka cluster's listeners are configured to require a specific authentication type.
* *Client-Side*: A client (a `KafkaUser` or a Kafka component managed by Strimzi) must be configured to provide matching credentials.

Listener authentication (Server-Side):: 
Listener authentication is configured per listener in the `spec.kafka.listeners` array of the `Kafka` custom resource. 
Supported types include `tls`, `scram-sha-512`, and `custom`.

Client authentication (Kafka user)::
For Kafka users, authentication is managed using the `KafkaUser` custom resource. Supported types are `tls`, `tls-external` (using an external CA), and `scram-sha-512`. 
Strimzi automatically creates the necessary `Secret` resources for the user.

Client authentication (Kafka components)::
For internal components, authentication is managed in the custom resource of the component, such as `KafkaConnect`.
Supported types include `tls`, `scram-sha-256`, `scram-sha-512`, `plain`, and `custom`.  

=== Authorization (cluster-wide)
[id="glossary-authorization_{context}"]
Defines which actions an authenticated client is permitted to perform on Kafka resources, such as writing to or reading from a topic. 
Configuration involves setting a cluster-wide mechanism and then, if required, defining user-specific rules.

Cluster-wide authorization::
This defines the overall mechanism used by the Kafka cluster to control client actions. 
It's configured in the `spec.kafka.authorization` section of the `Kafka` custom resource. 
Supported types include `simple` (using the Kafka's built-in authorizer) and `custom` (using custom authorizers).

User authorization (ACLs)::
This defines specific Access Control Lists (ACLs) for a user, granting permissions to perform actions on `Kafka` resources. 
The ACLs are defined in the `spec.authorization` section of the `KafkaUser` custom resource.
If using a custom authorization mechanism, user permissions are typically managed within the external authorization system and not through the `KafkaUser` resource.

== C

=== Clients CA
[id="glossary-clients-ca_{context}"]
A Certificate Authority managed by the Strimzi Cluster Operator that issues TLS certificates to secure communication between external clients and Kafka brokers. 
It can also be used for TLS client authentication.
Certificates signed by this CA are trusted by Kafka listeners configured for TLS-based client authentication.

=== Cluster CA
[id="glossary-cluster-ca_{context}"]
A Certificate Authority managed by the Strimzi Cluster Operator that issues TLS certificates to secure communication between Kafka brokers and other internal components.

=== Cluster Operator
[id="glossary-cluster-operator_{context}"]
The central operator responsible for deploying and managing Kafka clusters, Kafka Connect, Kafka MirrorMaker, and related components.

=== Cruise Control
[id="glossary-cruise-control_{context}"]
A component that provides support for automated Kafka cluster rebalancing and optimization, configured through the `Kafka` custom resource.

== D

=== Drain Cleaner
[id="glossary-drain-cleaner_{context}"]
A utility installed as a separate component that ensures safe pod evictions during rolling updates to prevent data loss or downtime.

== E

=== Encryption
[id="glossary-encryption_{context}"]
Strimzi supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between Kafka and its clients. TLS is enabled per listener in the `Kafka` custom resource, and communication between internal components is always encrypted.

=== Entity Operator
[id="glossary-entity-operator_{context}"]
The Entity Operator runs the Topic Operator and User Operator in separate containers within its pod, allowing them to handle topic and user management.

== F

=== Feature gate
[id="glossary-feature-gate_{context}"]
Used to enable or disable specific features and functions managed by Strimzi operators.
New features may be introduced initially through feature gates.

== K

=== Kafka (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafka-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource for deploying and configuring a Kafka cluster, including settings for nodes, listeners, storage, security, and internal components like Cruise Control and the Entity Operator.

=== Kafka Bridge
[id="glossary-kafka-bridge_{context}"]
Provides a RESTful interface that allows HTTP-based clients to interact with a Kafka cluster.

=== KafkaBridge (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkabridge-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource used to deploy and configure a Kafka Bridge instance, specifying replicas, authentication, and connection details.

=== KafkaConnect (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkaconnect-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource used to deploy and configure a Kafka Connect cluster for integrating external systems with Kafka.

=== KafkaConnector (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkaconnector-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource for managing individual Kafka connectors in a Kafka Connect cluster declaratively and independently of the `KafkaConnect` deployment.

=== KafkaExporter (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkaexporter-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource used to deploy the Kafka Exporter, which exposes Kafka metrics for Prometheus. 
It is configured as part of the `Kafka` custom resource.

=== KafkaMirrorMaker2 (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkamirrormaker2-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource for deploying a Kafka MirrorMaker 2 instance to replicate data between Kafka clusters.

=== KafkaNodePool (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkanodepool-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource used to configure distinct groups of nodes within a Kafka cluster.
Nodes in a node pool can be configured to operate as Kafka brokers, controllers, or both.

=== KafkaRebalance (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkarebalance-cr_{context}"]
A custom resource that triggers and manages cluster rebalancing through Cruise Control by setting optimization goals.

Rebalance modes:

full:: Load rebalanced across all brokers  
add-brokers:: Replicas moved to newly added brokers  
remove-brokers:: Replicas moved off brokers being removed  
remove-disks:: Data moved between storage volumes within the same broker  

=== KafkaTopic (custom resource)
[id="glossary-kafkatopic-cr_{context}"]

== L

=== Listener
[id="glossary-listener_{context}"]
Defines how clients connect to the Kafka cluster. Strimzi supports several listener types for exposing Kafka internally or externally.

Listener types:

internal:: Kafka exposed only within the Kubernetes cluster  
route:: Kafka exposed externally using OpenShift Routes  
loadbalancer:: Kafka exposed externally using a `LoadBalancer` service  
nodeport:: Kafka exposed externally using `NodePort` services  
ingress:: Kafka exposed externally using Kubernetes NGINX Ingress with TLS passthrough  
cluster-ip:: Kafka exposed using a per-broker `ClusterIP` service

=== Logging (configuration)
[id="glossary-logging-configuration_{context}"]
Logging for Kafka components and Strimzi operators is configured through their custom resources.  
The configuration uses Log4j2 and supports dynamic updates without restarting pods.

Configuration methods:

inline:: Loggers and levels are defined directly in the custom resource.  
Used for simple changes to log levels.

external:: Loggers and levels are defined in a `ConfigMap` referenced by the custom resource.  
Used for complex, reusable, or filtered configurations.

A component that exposes Kafka broker metrics directly in Prometheus format, enabled through the `metricsConfig` property in the `Kafka` custom resource.

== N

=== Network policy
[id="glossary-network-policy_{context}"]
Strimzi automatically creates a `NetworkPolicy` resource for each listener, allowing connections from all namespaces by default. You can configure the `networkPolicyPeers` property to restrict access to specific applications or namespaces.
