// Module included in the following assemblies:
//
// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// Base the file name and the ID on the module title. For example:
// * file name: my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='my-concept-module-a']
// * Title: = My concept module A

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not broken.
[id='concept-explanation-{context}']
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is reused multiple times in a guide.
= Concept explanation
//In the title of concept modules, include nouns or noun phrases that are used in the body text. This helps readers and search engines find the information quickly.
//Do not start the title of concept modules with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

A short introductory paragraph is required for the concept module.
It will provide an overview of the module.

The contents of a concept module give the user descriptions and explanations needed to understand and use a product.

* Look at nouns and noun phrases in related procedure modules and assemblies to find the concepts to explain to users.
* Explain only things that are visible to users. Even if a concept is interesting, it probably does not require explanation if it is not visible to users.
* Do not include any instructions to perform an action, such as executing a command. Action items belong in procedure modules.
