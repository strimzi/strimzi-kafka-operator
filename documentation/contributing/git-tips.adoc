== Delete Branches

To delete all of your branches except the branch you are on:

[source]
----
$ git checkout master
$ for br in `git branch` ; do git branch -D $br ; done
----

To delete one branch:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -D <branch-name>
----

== Resolve Conflicts

To resolve a merge conflict in an existing pull request:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git checkout <branch-name>
$ git branch -u origin <branch-name>
$ git pull --rebase upstream master
$ git push -f origin HEAD
----

== Reset Your Fork

If your fork is both ahead of and behind the origin you can reset your fork to match the origin and start with a clean slate.

[source]
----
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
$ git push origin master --force
$ git pull upstream master
$ git push origin master --force
----

== Access Another Writer’s Unmerged Commits

This is the process you can use if you need commits another writer has submitted in a merge request that is not yet merged.

. Check out a new topic branch from upstream/master as you normally do.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout -b <new-topic-branch> upstream/master
----
. If you have not yet added that writer’s remote repository, add it now.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git remote add -f <user> git@github.com:<user>/strimzi-kafka-operator.git
----
. Rebase to bring in the changes that are in that user’s outstanding
 `origin/<merge-request-branch>` branch.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ git rebase <user>/<merge-request-branch>
----
+
(you'll see the following response)
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Fast-forwarded <new-topic-branch> to <user>/<merge-request-branch>
----
