# CHANGELOG

## 0.45.0

* Add support for Kafka 3.9.0 and 3.8.1. 
  Remove support for Kafka 3.7.0 and 3.7.1
* Ability to move data between JBOD disks using Cruise Control.
* Allow using custom certificates for communication with container registry in Kafka Connect Build with Kaniko 
* Only roll pods once for ClientsCa cert renewal.
  This change also means the restart reason ClientCaCertKeyReplaced is removed and either CaCertRenewed or CaCertHasOldGeneration will be used.
* Allow rolling update for new cluster CA trust (during Cluster CA key replacement) to continue where it left off before interruption without rolling all pods again.
* Update HTTP bridge to 0.31.1
* Add support for mounting CSI volumes using the `template` sections

### Major changes, deprecations and removals

* **Strimzi 0.45 is the last minor Strimzi version with support for ZooKeeper-based Apache Kafka clusters and MirrorMaker 1 deployments.**
  **Please make sure to [migrate to KRaft](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#assembly-kraft-mode-str) and MirrorMaker 2 before upgrading to Strimzi 0.46 or newer.**
* **Strimzi 0.45 is the last Strimzi version to include the [Strimzi EnvVar Configuration Provider](https://github.com/strimzi/kafka-env-var-config-provider) (deprecated in Strimzi 0.38.0) and [Strimzi MirrorMaker 2 Extensions](https://github.com/strimzi/mirror-maker-2-extensions) (deprecated in Strimzi 0.28.0).**
  Please use the Apache Kafka [EnvVarConfigProvider](https://github.com/strimzi/kafka-env-var-config-provider?tab=readme-ov-file#deprecation-notice) and [Identity Replication Policy](https://github.com/strimzi/mirror-maker-2-extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#identity-replication-policy) instead. 

## 0.44.0

* Add the "Unmanaged" KafkaTopic status update.
* The `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate moves to beta stage and is enabled by default.
  If needed, `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` can be disabled in the feature gates configuration in the Cluster Operator.
* Add support for managing connector offsets via KafkaConnector and KafkaMirrorMaker2 custom resources.
* Add support for templating `host` and `advertisedHost` fields in listener configuration.
* Allow configuration of environment variables based on Config Map or Secret for every container in the container template sections.
* Add support for disabling the generation of PodDisruptionBudget resources by the Cluster Operator.
* Add support for running an automatic rebalancing, via Cruise Control, when the cluster is scaled down or up:
  * after a scaling up, the operator triggers an auto-rebalancing for moving some of the existing partitions to the newly added brokers.
  * before scaling down, and if the brokers to remove are hosting partitions, the operator triggers an auto-rebalancing to these partitions off the brokers to make them free to be removed.
* Strimzi Access Operator 0.1.0 added to the installation files and examples

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* **From Strimzi 0.44.0 on, we support only Kubernetes 1.25 and newer.**
  Kubernetes 1.23 and 1.24 are not supported anymore.
* When finalizers are enabled (default), the Topic Operator will no longer restore finalizers on unmanaged `KafkaTopic` resources if they are removed, aligning the behavior with paused topics, where finalizers are also not restored.
  This change matches user expectations.
* The External Configuration (`.spec.externalConfiguration`) in `KafkaConnect` and `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resources is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  Please use the environment variables, additional volumes and volume mounts in Pod and container templates instead.
* The Strimzi Canary installation files were removed based on the [_Strimzi proposal 086_](https://github.com/strimzi/proposals/blob/main/086-archive-canary.md) as the project was discontinued and archived.

## 0.43.0

* Add support for Apache Kafka 3.8.0.
  Remove support for Apache Kafka 3.6.0, 3.6.1, and 3.6.2.
* Added alerts for Connectors/Tasks in failed state.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The storage overrides for configuring per-broker storage class are deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  If you are using the storage overrides, you should migrate to KafkaNodePool resources and use multiple node pools with a different storage class each. 
* Strimzi 0.43.0 (and any of its patch releases) is the last Strimzi version with support for Kubernetes 1.23 and 1.24.
  From Strimzi 0.44.0 on, we will support only Kubernetes 1.25 and newer.

## 0.42.0

* Add support for Kafka 3.7.1
* The `UseKRaft` feature gate moves to GA stage and is permanently enabled without the possibility to disable it.
  To use KRaft (ZooKeeper-less Apache Kafka), you still need to use the `strimzi.io/kraft: enabled` annotation on the `Kafka` custom resources or migrate from an existing ZooKeeper-based cluster.
* Update the base image used by Strimzi containers from UBI8 to UBI9
* Add support for filename patterns when configuring trusted certificates
* Enhance `KafkaBridge` resource with consumer inactivity timeout and HTTP consumer/producer enablement.
* Add support for feature gates to User and Topic Operators

* Update HTTP bridge to latest 0.29.0 release
* Uncommented and enabled (by default) KRaft-related metrics in the `kafka-metrics.yaml` example file.
* Added support for configuring the quotas plugin with type `strimzi` or `kafka` in the `Kafka` custom resource.
  The Strimzi Quotas plugin version was updated to 0.3.1.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `reconciliationIntervalSeconds` configuration for the Topic and User Operators is deprecated, and will be removed when upgrading schemas to v1.
  Use `reconciliationIntervalMs` converting the value to milliseconds.
* Usage of Strimzi Quotas plugin version 0.2.0 is not supported, the plugin was updated to 0.3.1 and changed significantly.
  Additionally, from Strimzi 0.42.0 the plugin should be configured in `.spec.kafka.quotas` section - the configuration of the plugin inside `.spec.kafka.config` is ignored and should be removed.

## 0.41.0

* Add support for Apache Kafka 3.6.2
* Provide metrics to monitor certificates expiration as well as modified `Strimzi Operators` dashboard to include certificate expiration per cluster.
* Add support for JBOD storage in KRaft mode.
  (Note: JBOD support in KRaft mode is considered early-access in Apache Kafka 3.7.x)
* Added support for topic replication factor change to the Unidirectional Topic Operator when Cruise Control integration is enabled.
* The `KafkaNodePools` feature gate moves to GA stage and is permanently enabled without the possibility to disable it.
  To use the Kafka Node Pool resources, you still need to use the `strimzi.io/node-pools: enabled` annotation on the `Kafka` custom resources.
* Added support for configuring the `externalIPs` field in node port type services.
* The `UnidirectionalTopicOperator` feature gate moves to GA stage and is permanently enabled without the possibility to disable it.
  If the topics whose names start with `strimzi-store-topic` and `strimzi-topic-operator` still exist, you can delete them.
* Don't allow MirrorMaker2 mirrors with target set to something else than the connect cluster. 
* Added support for custom SASL config in standalone Topic Operator deployment to support alternate access controllers (i.e. `AWS_MSK_IAM`)
* Remove Angular dependent plugins from Grafana example dashboard. This makes our dashboard compatible with Grafana 7.4.5 and higher.
* Continue reconciliation after failed manual rolling update using the `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` annotation (when the `ContinueReconciliationOnManualRollingUpdateFailure` feature gate is enabled).

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `tlsSidecar` configuration for the Entity Operator is now deprecated and will be ignored.
* The `zookeeperSessionTimeoutSeconds` and `topicMetadataMaxAttempts` configurations for the Entity Topic Operator have been removed and will be ignored.

## 0.40.0

* Add support for Apache Kafka 3.7.0.
  Remove support for Apache Kafka 3.5.0, 3.5.1, and 3.5.2.
* The `UseKRaft` feature gate moves to beta stage and is enabled by default.
  If needed, `UseKRaft` can be disabled in the feature gates configuration in the Cluster Operator.
* Add support for ZooKeeper to KRaft migration by enabling the users to move from using ZooKeeper to store metadata to use KRaft.
* Add support for moving from dedicated controller-only KRaft nodes to mixed KRaft nodes
* Fix NullPointerException from missing listenerConfig when using custom auth
* Added support for Kafka Exporter `offset.show-all` parameter
* Prevent removal of the `broker` process role from KRaft mixed-nodes that have assigned partition-replicas
* Improve broker scale-down prevention to continue in reconciliation when scale-down cannot be executed
* Added support for Tiered Storage by enabling the configuration of custom storage plugins through the Kafka custom resource.
* Update HTTP bridge to latest 0.28.0 release

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* **From Strimzi 0.40.0 on, we support only Kubernetes 1.23 and newer.**
  Kubernetes 1.21 and 1.22 are not supported anymore.
* [#9508](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/9508) fixes the Strimzi CRDs and their definitions of labels and annotations.
  This change brings our CRDs in-sync with the Kubernetes APIs.
  After this fix, the label and annotation definitions in our CRDs (for example in the `template` sections) cannot contain integer values anymore and have to always use string values.
  If your custom resources use an integer value, for example:
  ```
  template:
    apiService:
      metadata:
        annotations:
          discovery.myapigateway.io/port: 8080
  ```
  You might get an error similar to this when applying the resource:
  ```
  * spec.template.apiService.metadata.annotations.discovery.myapigateway.io/port: Invalid value: "integer": spec.template.apiService.metadata.annotations.discovery.myapigateway.io/port in body must be of type string: "integer"
  ```
  To fix the issue, just use a string value instead of an integer:
  ```
  template:
    apiService:
      metadata:
        annotations:
          discovery.myapigateway.io/port: "8080"
  ```
* Support for the JmxTrans component is now completely removed.
  If you are upgrading from Strimzi 0.34 or earlier and have JmxTrans enabled in `.spec.jmxTrans` of the `Kafka` custom resource, you should disable it before the upgrade or delete it manually after the upgrade is complete.
* The `api` module was refactored and classes were moved to new packages.
* Strimzi Drain Cleaner 1.1.0 (included in the Strimzi 0.40.0 installation files) changes the way it handles Kubernetes eviction requests.
  It denies them instead of allowing them.
  This new behavior does not require the `PodDisruptionBudget` to be set to `maxUnavailable: 0`.
  We expect this to improve the compatibility with various tools used for scaling Kubernetes clusters such as [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh/).
  If you observe any problems with your toolchain or just want to stick with the previous behavior, you can use the `STRIMZI_DENY_EVICTION` environment variable and set it to `false` to switch back to the old (legacy) mode.

## 0.39.0

* Add support for Apache Kafka 3.5.2 and 3.6.1
* The `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate moves to GA stage and is now permanently enabled without the possibility to disable it.
  All Connect and Mirror Maker 2 operands will now use StrimziPodSets.
* The `KafkaNodePools` feature gate moves to beta stage and is enabled by default.
  If needed, `KafkaNodePools` can be disabled in the feature gates configuration in the Cluster Operator.
* The `UnidirectionalTopicOperator` feature gate moves to beta stage and is enabled by default.
  If needed, `UnidirectionalTopicOperator` can be disabled in the feature gates configuration in the Cluster Operator.
* Improved Kafka Connect metrics and dashboard example files
* Allow specifying and managing KRaft metadata version
* Add support for KRaft to KRaft upgrades (Apache Kafka upgrades for the KRaft based clusters)
* Improved Kafka Mirror Maker 2 dashboard example file

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate moves to GA stage and cannot be disabled anymore.
  When using Connect or Mirror Maker 2 operands, direct downgrade to Strimzi versions older than 0.34 is not supported anymore.
  You have to first downgrade to Strimzi version between 0.34 to 0.38, disable the `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate, and only then downgrade to an older Strimzi version.
* Strimzi 0.39.0 (and any of its patch releases) is the last Strimzi version with support for Kubernetes 1.21 and 1.22.
  From Strimzi 0.40.0 on, we will support only Kubernetes 1.23 and newer.

## 0.38.0

* Add support for Apache Kafka 3.6.0 and drop support for 3.4.0 and 3.4.1
* Sign containers using `cosign`
* Generate and publish Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) of Strimzi containers
* Add support for stopping connectors according to [Strimzi Proposal #54](https://github.com/strimzi/proposals/blob/main/054-stopping-kafka-connect-connectors.md)
* Allow manual rolling of Kafka Connect and Kafka Mirror Maker 2 pods using the `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` annotation (supported only when `StableConnectIdentities` feature gate is enabled) 
* Make sure brokers are empty before scaling them down
* Update Cruise Control to 2.5.128
* Add support for pausing reconciliations to the Unidirectional Topic Operator
* Allow running ZooKeeper and KRaft based Apache Kafka clusters in parallel when the `+UseKRaft` feature gate is enabled
* Add support for metrics to the Unidirectional Topic Operator
* Added the `includeAcceptHeader` option to OAuth client and listener authentication configuration and to `keycloak` authorization. If set to `false` it turns off sending of `Accept` header when communicating with OAuth / OIDC authorization server. This feature is enabled by the updated Strimzi Kafka OAuth library (0.14.0).
* Update HTTP bridge to latest 0.27.0 release

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `Kafka.KafkaStatus.ListenerStatus.type` property has been deprecated for a long time, and now we do not use it anymore.
  The current plan is to completely remove this property in the next schema version.
  If needed, you can use the `Kafka.KafkaStatus.ListenerStatus.name` property, which has the same value.
* Added `strimzi.io/kraft` annotation to be applied on `Kafka` custom resource, together with the `+UseKRaft` feature gate enabled, to declare a ZooKeeper or KRaft based cluster.
  * if `enabled` the `Kafka` resource defines a KRaft-based cluster.
  * if `disabled`, missing or any other value, the operator handle the `Kafka` resource as a ZooKeeper-based cluster.
* The `io.strimzi.kafka.EnvVarConfigProvider` configuration provider is now deprecated and will be removed in Strimzi 0.42. Users should migrate to Kafka's implementation, `org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.EnvVarConfigProvider`, which is a drop-in replacement.
  For example:
  ```yaml
  config:
    # ...
    config.providers: env
    config.providers.env.class: io.strimzi.kafka.EnvVarConfigProvider
    # ...
  ```
  becomes
  ```yaml
  config:
    # ...
    config.providers: env
    config.providers.env.class: org.apache.kafka.common.config.provider.EnvVarConfigProvider
    # ...
  ```
  
## 0.37.0

* The `StableConnectIdentites` feature gate moves to beta stage.
  By default, StrimziPodSets are used for Kafka Connect and Kafka Mirror Maker 2.
  If needed, `StableConnectIdentites` can be disabled in the feature gates configuration in the Cluster Operator.
* Support for the `ppc64le` platform
* Added version fields to the `Kafka` custom resource status to track install and upgrade state
* Support for infinite auto-restarts of Kafka Connect and Kafka Mirror Maker 2 connectors

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* **Removed support for OpenTracing**:
  * The `tracing.type: jaeger` configuration, in `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, `KafkaMirrorMaker2` and `KafkaBridge` resources, is not supported anymore.
  * The OpenTelemetry based tracing is the only available by using `tracing.type: opentelemetry`.
* **The default behavior of the Kafka Connect connector auto-restart has changed.**
  When the auto-restart feature is enabled in `KafkaConnector` or `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resources, it will now continue to restart the connectors indefinitely rather than stopping after 7 restarts, as previously.
  If you want to use the original behaviour, use the `.spec.autoRestart.maxRestarts` option to configure the maximum number of restarts.
  For example:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
  kind: KafkaConnector
  metadata:
    labels:
      strimzi.io/cluster: my-connect
    name: echo-sink-connector
  spec:
    # ...
    autoRestart:
      enabled: true
      maxRestarts: 7
    # ...
  ```
* **The automatic configuration of Cruise Control CPU capacity has been changed in this release**:
  * There are three ways to configure Cruise Control CPU capacity values:
    * `.spec.cruiseControl.brokerCapacity` (for all brokers)
    * `.spec.cruiseControl.brokerCapacity.overrides` (per broker)
    * Kafka resource requests and limits (for all brokers).
  * The precedence of which Cruise Control CPU capacity configuration is used has been changed.
  * In previous Strimzi versions, the Kafka resource limit (if set) took precedence, regardless if any other CPU configurations were set.
    * For example:
      * (1) Kafka resource limits
      * (2) `.spec.cruiseControl.brokerCapacity.overrides`
      * (3) `.spec.cruiseControl.brokerCapacity`
  * This previous behavior was identified as a bug and was fixed in this Strimzi release.
  * Going forward, the brokerCapacity overrides per broker take top precedence, then general brokerCapacity configuration, and then the Kafka resource requests, then the Kafka resource limits.
    * For example:
      * (1) `.spec.cruiseControl.brokerCapacity.overrides`
      * (2) `.spec.cruiseControl.brokerCapacity`
      * (3) Kafka resource requests
      * (4) Kafka resource limits
    * When none of Cruise Control CPU capacity configurations mentioned above are configured, CPU capacity will be set to `1`.
 as any _override_ value configured in the `.spec.cruiseControl` section of the `Kafka` custom resource.

## 0.36.1

* Fixed ordering of JVM performance options [#8579](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/8579)
* Log a warning when a KafkaTopic has no spec [#8465](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/8465)
* Updated Strimzi OAuth library to 0.13.0 with better support for KRaft

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* **From Strimzi 0.36.0 on, we support only Kubernetes 1.21 and newer.**
  Kubernetes 1.19 and 1.20 are not supported anymore.
* Enabling the `UseKRaft` feature gate is now possible only together with the `KafkaNodePools` feature gate.
  To deploy a Kafka cluster in the KRaft mode, you have to use the `KafkaNodePool` resources.
* The Helm Chart repository at `https://strimzi.io/charts/` is now deprecated.
  Please use the Helm Chart OCI artifacts from our [Helm Chart OCI repository instead](https://quay.io/organization/strimzi-helm).
* Option `customClaimCheck` of 'oauth' authentication which relies on JsonPath changed the handling of equal comparison against `null` as the behaviour was buggy and is now fixed in the updated version of JsonPath library [OAuth #196](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-oauth/pull/196)

## 0.35.0

* Redesigned the Cluster and User Operator configuration to make it more efficient and flexible
* Allow multiple imagePullSecrets in the Strimzi Helm chart
* Remove support for JMX Trans
* Move feature gate `UseStrimziPodSets` to GA and remove support for StatefulSets

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* Strimzi 0.35.0 (and any possible patch releases) is the last Strimzi version with support for Kubernetes 1.19 and 1.20.
  From Strimzi 0.36.0 on, we will support only Kubernetes 1.21 and newer.
* Support for JMX Trans has been removed in Strimzi 0.35.0.
  If you have JMX Trans enabled in your `Kafka` custom resource in the `.spec.jmxTrans` section, you should remove it.
  If you upgrade to Strimzi 0.35.0 or newer with JMX Trans deployed / enabled in the `Kafka` custom resource, Strimzi will be automatically deleted after the upgrade.
* The feature gate `UseStrimziPodSets` has graduated to GA and cannot be disabled anymore.
  The StatefulSet template properties in the `Kafka` custom resource in `.spec.zookeeper.template.statefulSet` and `.spec.kafka.template.statefulSet` are deprecated and will be ignored.
  You should remove them from your custom resources.

* Stable Pod identities for Kafka Connect and MirrorMaker 2 (Feature Gate `StableConnectIdentities`)
* Use JDK HTTP client in the Kubernetes client instead of the OkHttp client
* Add truststore configuration for HTTPS connections to OPA server
* Add image digest support in Helm chart
* Added the `httpRetries` and `httpRetryPauseMs` options to OAuth authentication configuration. They are set to `0` by default - no retries, no backoff between retries.

* Support for configuring the metadata for the Role / RoleBinding of Entity Operator
* Add liveness and readiness probes specifically for nodes running in KRaft combined mode
* Upgrade HTTP bridge to latest 0.24.0 release

### Known issues

* The TLS passthrough feature of the Ingress-NGINX Controller for Kubernetes is not compatible with some new TLS features supported by Java 17 such as the _session tickets extension_.
  If you use `type: ingress` listener with enabled mTLS authentication, we recommend you to test if your clients are affected or not.
  If needed, you can also disable the _session ticket extension_ in the Kafka brokers in your `Kafka` custom resource by setting the `jdk.tls.server.enableSessionTicketExtension` Java system property to `false`:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
  kind: Kafka
  metadata:
    # ...
  spec:
    # ...
    kafka:
      jvmOptions:
        javaSystemProperties:
          - name: jdk.tls.server.enableSessionTicketExtension
            value: "false"
    # ...
  ```
  For more details, see [kubernetes/ingress-nginx#9540](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/9540).

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `UseStrimziPodSet` feature gate will move to GA in Strimzi 0.35.
  Support for StatefulSets will be removed from Strimzi right after the 0.34 release.
  Please use the Strimzi 0.33 release to test StrimziPodSets in your environment and report any major or blocking issues before the StatefulSet support is removed.
* The default length of any new SCRAM-SHA-512 passwords will be 32 characters instead of 12 characters used in the previous Strimzi versions.
  Existing passwords will not be affected by this change until they are regenerated (for example because the user secret is deleted).
  If you want to keep using the original password length, you can set it using the `STRIMZI_SCRAM_SHA_PASSWORD_LENGTH` environment variable in `.spec.entityOperator.template.userOperatorContainer.env` in the `Kafka` custom resource or in the `Deployment` of the standalone User Operator.
  ```yaml
  userOperatorContainer:
    env:
      - name: STRIMZI_SCRAM_SHA_PASSWORD_LENGTH
        value: "12"
  ```
* In previous versions, the `ssl.secure.random.implementation` option in Kafka brokers was always set to `SHA1PRNG`.
  From Strimzi 0.33 on, it is using the default SecureRandom implementation from the Java Runtime.
  If you want to keep using `SHA1PRNG` as your SecureRandom, you can configure it in `.spec.kafka.config` in your `Kafka` custom resource.
* Support for JmxTrans in Strimzi is deprecated. 
  It is currently planned to be removed in Strimzi 0.35.0.
* Support for `type: jaeger` tracing based on Jaeger clients and OpenTracing API was deprecated in the Strimzi 0.31 release.
  As the Jaeger clients are retired and the OpenTracing project is archived, we cannot guarantee their support for future versions.
  In Strimzi 0.32 and 0.33, we added support for OpenTelemetry tracing as a replacement.
  If possible, we will maintain the support for `type: jaeger` tracing until June 2023 and remove it afterwards.
  Please migrate to OpenTelemetry as soon as possible.
* When OpenTelemetry is enabled for tracing, starting from this release, the operator configures the OTLP exporter instead of the Jaeger one by default.
  The Jaeger exporter is even not included in the Kafka images anymore, so if you want to use it you have to add the binary by yourself.
  The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable has to be used instead of the `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` in order to specify the OTLP endpoint to send traces to.
  If you are using Jaeger as the backend system for tracing, you need to have 1.35 release at least which is the first one exposing an OTLP endpoint.

## 0.32.0

* Add support for Kafka 3.3.1 and remove support for Kafka 3.1.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1.2
* Update Open Policy Agent (OPA) Authorizer to 1.5.0
* Update KafkaConnector CR status so the 'NotReady' condition is added if the connector or any tasks are reporting a 'FAILED' state.
* Add auto-approval mechanism on KafkaRebalance resource when an optimization proposal is ready
* The `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate moves to GA
* Add client rack-awareness support to Strimzi Bridge pods
* Add support for OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
  * Kafka Connect, Mirror Maker, Mirror Maker 2 and Strimzi Bridge can be configured to use OpenTelemetry
  * Using Jaeger exporter by default for backward compatibility
* Updated JMX Exporter dependency to 0.17.2
* ZookeeperRoller considers unready pods
* Support multiple operations per ACLRule
* Upgrade Vert.x to 4.3.4
* Add `cluster-ip` listener. We can use it with a tcp port configuration in an ingress controller to expose kafka with an optional tls encryption and a single LoadBalancer.
* Update Strimzi OAuth library to 0.11.0

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* **From 0.32.0 on, Strimzi supports only Kubernetes version 1.19 and newer.**
* A connector or task failing triggers a 'NotReady' condition to be added to the KafkaConnector CR status. This is different from previous versions where the CR would report 'Ready' even if the connector or a task had failed.
* The `ClusterRole` from file `020-ClusterRole-strimzi-cluster-operator-role.yaml` was split into two separate roles:
  * The original `strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced` `ClusterRole` in the file `020-ClusterRole-strimzi-cluster-operator-role.yaml` contains the rights related to the resources created based on some Strimzi custom resources.
  * The new `strimzi-cluster-operator-watched` `ClusterRole` in the file `023-ClusterRole-strimzi-cluster-operator-role.yaml` contains the rights required to watch and manage the Strimzi custom resources.
  
  When deploying the Strimzi Cluster Operator as cluster-wide, the `strimzi-cluster-operator-watched` `ClusterRole` needs to be always granted at the cluster level.
  But the `strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced` `ClusterRole` might be granted only for the namespaces where any custom resources are created.
* The `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate moves to GA. 
  Direct upgrade from Strimzi 0.22 or earlier is not possible anymore.
  You have to upgrade first to one of the Strimzi versions between 0.22 and 0.32 before upgrading to Strimzi 0.32 or newer.
  Please follow the docs for more details.  
* The `spec.authorization.acls[*].operation` field in the `KafkaUser` resource has been deprecated in favour of the field
  `spec.authorization.acls[*].operations` which allows to set multiple operations per ACLRule.

### Deprecations and removals

* Strimzi 0.31.0 (and any possible patch releases) is the last Strimzi version with support for Kubernetes 1.16, 1.17 and 1.18.
  From Strimzi 0.32.0 on, we will support only Kubernetes 1.19 and newer.
  The supported Kubernetes versions will be re-evaluated again in Q1/2023.
* The `type: jaeger` tracing support based on Jaeger clients and OpenTracing API is now deprecated.
  Because the Jaeger clients are retired and the OpenTracing project is archived, we cannot guarantee their support for future Kafka versions.
  In the future, we plan to replace it with a new tracing feature based on the OpenTelemetry project.

## 0.30.0

* Remove Kafka 3.0.0 and 3.0.1
* Add support for `simple` authorization and for the User Operator to the experimental `UseKRaft` feature gate
  _(Note: Due to [KAFKA-13909](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-13909), broker restarts currently don't work when authorization is enabled.)_
* Add network capacity overrides for Cruise Control capacity config
* The `ServiceAccountPatching` feature gate moves to GA.
  It cannot be disabled anymore and will be permanently enabled.
* The `UseStrimziPodSets` feature gate moves to beta stage.
  By default, StrimziPodSets are used instead of StatefulSets.
  If needed, `UseStrimziPodSets` can be disabled in the feature gates configuration in the Cluster Operator.
* Use better encryption and digest algorithms when creating the PKCS12 stores.
  For existing clusters, the certificates will not be updated during upgrade but only next time the PKCS12 store is created. 
* Add CPU capacity overrides for Cruise Control capacity config
* Use CustomResource existing spec and status to fix Quarkus native build's serialization
* Update JMX Exporter to version 0.17.0

* Allow Cruise Control topic names to be configured
* Add support for `spec.rack.topologyKey` property in Mirror Maker 2 to enable "fetch from the closest replica" feature.
* Support for the s390x platform
  _(The s390x support is currently considered as experimental. We are not aware of any issues, but the s390x build doesn't at this point undergo the same level of testing as the AMD64 container images.)_
* Update Strimzi Kafka Bridge to 0.21.5
* Added rebalancing modes on the `KafkaRebalance` custom resource
  * `full`: this mode runs a full rebalance moving replicas across all the brokers in the cluster. This is the default one if not specified.
  * `add-brokers`: after scaling up the cluster, this mode is used to move replicas to the newly added brokers specified in the custom resource.
  * `remove-brokers`: this mode is used to move replicas off the brokers that are going to be removed, before scaling down the cluster.
* **Experimental** KRaft mode (ZooKeeper-less Kafka) which can be enabled using the `UseKRaft` feature gate.
  **Important: Use it for development and testing only!**

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* Since the Cruise Control TLS sidecar has been removed, the related configuration options `.spec.cruiseControl.tlsSidecar` and `.spec.cruiseControl.template.tlsSidecar` in the Kafka custom resource are now deprecated.

## 0.28.0

* Added the `connectTimeoutSeconds` and `readTimeoutSeconds` options to OAuth authentication configuration. The default connect and read timeouts are set to 60 seconds (previously there was no timeout). Also added `groupsClaim` and `groupsClaimDelimiter` options in the listener configuration of Kafka Spec to allow extracting group information from JWT token at authentication time, and making it available to the custom authorizer. These features are enabled by the updated Strimzi Kafka OAuth library (0.10.0).
* Add support for disabling the FIPS mode in OpenJDK
* Fix renewing your own CA certificates [#5466](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/5466)

  Please update to Kafka's own Identity Replication Policy (class `org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.IdentityReplicationPolicy`).
* The `type` field in `ListenerStatus` has been deprecated and will be removed in the future.
* The `disk` and `cpuUtilization` fields in the `spec.cruiseControl.capacity` section of the Kafka resource have been deprecated, are ignored, and will be removed in the future.

## 0.27.0

* Multi-arch container images with support for x86_64 / AMD64 and AArch64 / ARM64 platforms
  _(The support AArch64 is currently considered as experimental. We are not aware of any issues, but the AArch64 build doesn't at this point undergo the same level of testing as the AMD64 container images.)_
* Added the option to configure the Cluster Operator's Zookeeper admin client session timeout via an new env var: `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`
* The `ControlPlaneListener` and `ServiceAccountPatching` feature gates are now in the _beta_ phase and are enabled by default.

* Added SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication for Kafka clients
* Update OPA Authorizer to 1.3.0
* Update to Cruise Control version 2.5.79
* Update Log4j2 to 2.17.0

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate is now enabled by default.
  When upgrading from Strimzi 0.22 or earlier, you have to disable the `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate when upgrading the cluster operator to make sure the Kafka cluster stays available during the upgrade.
  When downgrading to Strimzi 0.22 or earlier, you have to disable the `ControlPlaneListener` feature gate before downgrading the cluster operator to make sure the Kafka cluster stays available during the downgrade.

## 0.26.0

* Add support for Kafka 2.8.1 and 3.0.0; remove Kafka 2.7.0 and 2.7.1

* Allow to configure `/tmp` volume size via Pod template. By default `1Mi` is used.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* imageRepositoryOverride,imageRegistryOverride and imageTagOverride are now removed from values.yaml. defaultImageRepository, defaultImageRegistry and defaultImageTag values are introduced in helm charts which sets the default registry, repository and tags for the images. Now the registry, repository and tag for a single image can be configured as per the requirement.
* The OpenShift Templates were removed from the examples and are no longer supported (#5548)
* Kafka MirrorMaker 1 has been deprecated in Apache Kafka 3.0.0 and will be removed in Apache Kafka 4.0.0.
  As a result, the `KafkaMirrorMaker` custom resource which is used to deploy Kafka MirrorMaker 1 has been deprecated in Strimzi as well. (#5617)
  The `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource will be removed from Strimzi when we adopt Apache Kafka 4.0.0.
  As a replacement, use the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` custom resource with the [`IdentityReplicationPolicy`](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/using.html#unidirectional_replication_activepassive).

## 0.25.0

* Move from Scala 2.12 to Scala 2.13. (#5192)

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `KafkaConnectS2I` resource has been removed and is no longer supported by the operator.
  Please use the [migration guide](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/0.24.0/full/using.html#proc-migrating-kafka-connect-s2i-str) to migrate your `KafkaConnectS2I` deployments to [`KafkaConnect` Build](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* The Open Policy Agent authorizer has been updated to a new version that supports Scala 2.13.
  The new release introduces a new format of the input data sent to the Open Policy Agent server.
  For more information about the new format and how to migrate from the old version, see the [OPA Kafka plugin v1.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/Bisnode/opa-kafka-plugin/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
* User Operator now uses Kafka Admin API to manage SCRAM-SHA-512 credentials.
  All operations done by the User Operator now use Kafka Admin API and connect directly to Kafka instead of ZooKeeper.
  As a result, the environment variables `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT` and `STRIMZI_ZOOKEEPER_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS` were removed from the User Operator configuration.
* All `emptyDir` volumes used by Strimzi for temporary files have now configured a fixed size limit.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The deprecated `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource will be removed after the 0.24.0 release. 
  Please use the [migration guide](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/using.html#proc-migrating-kafka-connect-s2i-str) to migrate your `KafkaConnectS2I` deployments to [`KafkaConnect` Build](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* The fields `topicsBlacklistPattern` and `groupsBlacklistPattern` in the `KafkaMirrorMaker2` resource are deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  They are replaced by new fields `topicsExcludePattern` and `groupsExcludePattern`.
* The field `whitelist` in the `KafkaMirrorMaker` resource is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  It is replaced with a new field `include`.
* `bind-utils` removed from containers to improve security posture.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* Strimzi API versions `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` were removed from all Strimzi custom resources apart from `KafkaTopic` and `KafkaUser` (use `v1beta2` versions instead)
* The following annotations have been removed and cannot be used anymore:
  * `cluster.operator.strimzi.io/delete-claim` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/delete-claim`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/generation` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/generation`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` (use `strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` instead)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` (use `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` instead)
* When the `class` field is configured in the `configuration` section of an Ingress-type listener, Strimzi will not automatically set the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation anymore. In case you still need this annotation, you can set it manually in the listener configuration using the [`annotations` field](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/using.html#property-listener-config-annotations-reference) or in the [`.spec.kafka.template` section](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/using.html#type-KafkaClusterTemplate-reference).
* The `.spec.kafkaExporter.template.service` section in the `Kafka` custom resource has been deprecated and will be removed in the next API version (the service itself was removed several releases ago).

## 0.22.0

* Add support for Kafka 2.6.1
* List topics used by a Kafka Connect connector in the `.status` section of the `KafkaConnector` custom resource
* Bump Cruise Control to v2.5.37 for Kafka 2.7 support. Note this new version of Cruise Control uses `Log4j 2` and is supported by dynamic logging configuration (where logging properties are defined in a ConfigMap). However, existing `Log4j` configurations must be updated to `Log4j 2` configurations.
* Support pausing reconciliation of CR with annotation `strimzi.io/pause-reconciliation`

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* In the past, when no Ingress class was specified in the Ingress-type listener in the Kafka custom resource, the 
  `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation was automatically set to `nginx`. Because of the support for the new 
  IngressClass resource and the new `ingressClassName` field in the Ingress resource, the default value will not be set 
  anymore. Please use the `class` field in `.spec.kafka.listeners[].configuration` to specify the class name.
* The `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource is deprecated and will be removed in the future. You can use the new [`KafkaConnect` build feature](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* Removed support for Helm2 charts as that version is now unsupported. There is no longer the need for separate `helm2` and `helm3` binaries, only `helm` (version 3) is required.
* The following annotations are deprecated for a long time and will be removed in 0.23.0:
  * `cluster.operator.strimzi.io/delete-claim` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/delete-claim`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/generation` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/generation`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` (use `strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` instead)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` (use `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` instead)
* External logging configuration has changed. `spec.logging.name` is deprecated. Moved to `spec.logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.name`. Key in the `ConfigMap` is configurable via `spec.logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.key`.
  * from
  ```
  logging:
    type: external
    name: my-config-map
  ```
  * to
  ```
  logging:
    type: external
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config-map
        key: my-key
  ``` 
* Existing Cruise Control logging configurations must be updated from `Log4j` syntax to `Log4j 2` syntax.
  * For existing inline configurations, replace the `cruisecontrol.root.logger` property with `rootLogger.level`.
  * For existing external configurations, replace the existing configuration with a new configuration file named `log4j2.properties` using `log4j 2` syntax.

## 0.21.0

  * Support for re-authentication was added, which also enforces access token lifespan on the Kafka client session
  * Permission changes through Keycloak Authorization Services are now detected by Kafka Brokers

### Deprecations and removals

#### Redesign of the `.spec.kafka.listeners` section

The `.spec.kafka.listeners` section of the Kafka CRD has been redesigned to allow configuring more different listeners.
The old `listeners` object which allowed only configuration of one`plain`, one `tls`, and one `external` listener is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
It is replaced with an array allowing configuration of multiple different listeners:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: local
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external1
    port: 9093
    type: loadbalancer
    tls: true
  - name: external2
    port: 9094
    type: nodeport
    tls: true
```

This change includes some other changes:
* The `tls` field is now required.
* The former `overrides` section is now merged with the `configuration` section.
* The `dnsAnnotations` field has been renamed to `annotations` since we found out it has wider use.
* Configuration of `loadBalancerSourceRanges` and `externalTrafficPolicy` has been moved into listener configuration. Its use in the `template` section is now deprecated.
* For `type: internal` listeners, you can now use the flag `useServiceDnsDomain` to define whether they should use the fully qualified DNS names including the cluster service suffix (usually `.cluster.local`). This option defaults to false.
* All listeners now support configuring the advertised hostname and port.
* `preferredAddressType` has been removed to `preferredNodePortAddressType`.

To convert the old format into the new format with backwards compatibility, you should use following names and types:
* For the old `plain` listener, use the name `plain`, port `9092` and type `internal`.
* For the old `tls` listener, use the name `tls`, port `9093` and type `internal`.
* For the old `external` listener, use the name `external`, port `9094`.

For example the following old configuration:

```yaml
listeners:
  plain:
    # ...
  tls: 
    # ...
  external:
    type: loadbalancer 
    # ...
```

Will look like this in the new format:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: plain
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: false
  - name: tls
    port: 9093
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external
    port: 9094
    type: loadbalancer
    tls: true
```

#### Removal of monitoring port on Kafka and ZooKeeper related services

The `PodMonitor` resource is now used instead of the `ServiceMonitor` for scraping metrics from Kafka, ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect and so on.
For this reason, we have removed the monitoring port `tcp-prometheus` (9404) on all the services where it is declared (Kafka bootstrap, ZooKeeper client and so on).
It was already deprecated in the previous 0.19.0 release.
Together with it we have also removed the Prometheus annotations from the services. If you want to add them, you can use the templates.
See here https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/master/using.html#assembly-customizing-kubernetes-resources-str for more details about templates usage.
Finally, the Kafka Exporter service was has been removed because it was used just for the monitoring port.

#### Deprecation of Kafka TLS sidecar configuration

Since the Kafka TLS sidecar has been removed, the related configuration options in the Kafka custom resource are now deprecated:
* `.spec.kafka.tlsSidecar`
* `.spec.kafka.template.tlsSidecar`

## 0.19.0

* Use Strimzi Kafka Bridge 0.18.0
* Make it possible to configure labels and annotations for secrets created by the User Operator

### Deprecations and removals

#### Deprecation of Helm v2 chart

The Helm v2 support will end soon. 
Bug fixing should stop on August 13th 2020 and security fixes on November 13th.
See https://helm.sh/blog/covid-19-extending-helm-v2-bug-fixes/ for more details.

In sync with that, the Helm v2 chart of Strimzi Cluster Operator is now deprecated and will be removed in the future as Helm v2 support ends.
Since Strimzi 0.19.0, we have a new chart for Helm v3 which can be used instead.

#### Removal of v1alpha1 versions of several custom resources

In Strimzi 0.12.0, the `v1alpha1` versions of the following resources have been deprecated and replaced by `v1beta1`:
* `Kafka`
* `KafkaConnect`
* `KafkaConnectS2I`
* `KafkaMirrorMaker`
* `KafkaTopic`
* `KafkaUser`

In the next release, the `v1alpha1` versions of these resources will be removed. 
Please follow the guide for upgrading the resources: https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#assembly-upgrade-resources-str.

#### Removal deprecated cadvisor metric labels

The `pod_name` and `container_name` labels provided on the cadvisor metrics are now just `pod` and `container` starting from Kubernetes 1.16.
We removed the old ones from the Prometheus scraping configuration/alerts and on the Kafka and ZooKeeper dashboard as well.
It means that the charts related to memory and CPU usage are not going to work on Kuvbernetes version previous 1.14.
For more information on what is changed: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3312

#### Deprecation of monitoring port on Kafka and ZooKeeper related services

The `PodMonitor` resource is now used instead of the `ServiceMonitor` for scraping metrics from Kafka, ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect and so on.
For this reason, we are deprecating the monitoring port `tcp-prometheus` (9404) on all the services where it is declared (Kafka bootstrap, ZooKeeper client and so on).
This port will be removed in the next release.
Together with it we will also remove the Prometheus annotation from the service.

#### Removal warning of Cluster Operator log level

Because of the new Cluster Operator dynamic logging configuration via [PR#3328](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3328) we are going to remove the `STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable from the Cluster Operator deployment YAML file in the 0.20.0 release.
