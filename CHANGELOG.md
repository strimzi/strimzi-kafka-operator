* Support for configuring custom Authorizer implementation 

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* Strimzi API versions `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` were removed from all Strimzi custom resources apart from `KafkaTopic` and `KafkaUser` (use `v1beta2` versions instead)
* The following annotations have been removed and cannot be used anymore:
  * `cluster.operator.strimzi.io/delete-claim` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/delete-claim`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/generation` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/generation`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` (use `strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` instead)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` (use `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` instead)

## 0.22.0

* Add `v1beta2` version for all resources. `v1beta2` removes all deprecated fields.
* Add annotations that enable the operator to restart Kafka Connect connectors or tasks. The annotations can be applied to the KafkaConnector and the KafkaMirrorMaker2 custom resources.
* Add additional configuration options for the Kaniko executor used by the Kafka Connect Build on Kubernetes
* Add support for JMX options configuration of all Kafka Connect (KC, KC2SI, MM2)
* Update Strimzi Kafka OAuth to version 0.7 and add support for new features:

However, existing `Log4j` configurations must be updated to `Log4j 2` configurations.
* Support pausing reconciliation of CR with annotation `strimzi.io/pause-reconciliation`

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* In the past, when no Ingress class was specified in the Ingress-type listener in the Kafka custom resource, the 
  `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation was automatically set to `nginx`. Because of the support for the new 
  IngressClass resource and the new `ingressClassName` field in the Ingress resource, the default value will not be set 
  anymore. Please use the `class` field in `.spec.kafka.listeners[].configuration` to specify the class name. 
* The `KafkaConnectS2I` custom resource is deprecated and will be removed in the future. You can use the new [`KafkaConnect` build feature](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#creating-new-image-using-kafka-connect-build-str) instead.
* Removed support for Helm2 charts as that version is now unsupported. There is no longer the need for separate `helm2` and `helm3` binaries, only `helm` (version 3) is required.
* The following annotations are deprecated for a long time and will be removed in 0.23.0:
  * `cluster.operator.strimzi.io/delete-claim` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/delete-claim`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/generation` (used internally only - replaced by `strimzi.io/generation`)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` (use `strimzi.io/delete-pod-and-pvc` instead)
  * `operator.strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` (use `strimzi.io/manual-rolling-update` instead)
* External logging configuration has changed. `spec.logging.name` is deprecated. Moved to `spec.logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.name`. Key in the `ConfigMap` is configurable via `spec.logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.key`.
  * from
  ```
  logging:
    type: external
    name: my-config-map
  ```
  * to
  ```
  logging:
    type: external
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: my-config-map
        key: my-key
  ``` 
* Existing Cruise Control logging configurations must be updated from `Log4j` syntax to `Log4j 2` syntax.
  * For existing inline configurations, replace the `cruisecontrol.root.logger` property with `rootLogger.level`.
  * For existing external configurations, replace the existing configuration with a new configuration file named `log4j2.properties` using `log4j 2` syntax.

## 0.20.0

**Note: This is the last version of Strimzi that will support Kubernetes 1.11 and higher. Future versions will drop support for Kubernetes 1.11-1.15 and support only Kubernetes 1.16 and higher.**

* Add support for Kafka 2.5.1 and 2.6.0. Remove support for 2.4.0 and 2.4.1
* Remove TLS sidecars from Kafka pods => Kafka now uses native TLS to connect to ZooKeeper

  * Permission changes through Keycloak Authorization Services are now detected by Kafka Brokers

### Deprecations and removals

#### Redesign of the `.spec.kafka.listeners` section

The `.spec.kafka.listeners` section of the Kafka CRD has been redesigned to allow configuring more different listeners.
The old `listeners` object which allowed only configuration of one`plain`, one `tls`, and one `external` listener is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.
It is replaced with an array allowing configuration of multiple different listeners:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: local
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external1
    port: 9093
    type: loadbalancer
    tls: true
  - name: external2
    port: 9094
    type: nodeport
    tls: true
```

This change includes some other changes:
* The `tls` field is now required.
* The former `overrides` section is now merged with the `configuration` section.
* The `dnsAnnotations` field has been renamed to `annotations` since we found out it has wider use.
* Configuration of `loadBalancerSourceRanges` and `externalTrafficPolicy` has been moved into listener configuration. Its use in the `template` section is now deprecated.
* For `type: internal` listeners, you can now use the flag `useServiceDnsDomain` to define whether they should use the fully qualified DNS names including the cluster service suffix (usually `.cluster.local`). This option defaults to false.
* All listeners now support configuring the advertised hostname and port.
* `preferredAddressType` has been removed to `preferredNodePortAddressType`.

To convert the old format into the new format with backwards compatibility, you should use following names and types:
* For the old `plain` listener, use the name `plain`, port `9092` and type `internal`.
* For the old `tls` listener, use the name `tls`, port `9093` and type `internal`.
* For the old `external` listener, use the name `external`, port `9094`.

For example the following old configuration:

```yaml
listeners:
  plain:
    # ...
  tls: 
    # ...
  external:
    type: loadbalancer 
    # ...
```

Will look like this in the new format:

```yaml
listeners:
  - name: plain
    port: 9092
    type: internal
    tls: false
  - name: tls
    port: 9093
    type: internal
    tls: true
  - name: external
    port: 9094
    type: loadbalancer
    tls: true
```

#### Removal of monitoring port on Kafka and ZooKeeper related services

The `PodMonitor` resource is now used instead of the `ServiceMonitor` for scraping metrics from Kafka, ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect and so on.
For this reason, we have removed the monitoring port `tcp-prometheus` (9404) on all the services where it is declared (Kafka bootstrap, ZooKeeper client and so on).
It was already deprecated in the previous 0.19.0 release.
Together with it we have also removed the Prometheus annotations from the services. If you want to add them, you can use the templates.
See here https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/master/using.html#assembly-customizing-kubernetes-resources-str for more details about templates usage.
Finally, the Kafka Exporter service was has been removed because it was used just for the monitoring port.

#### Deprecation of Kafka TLS sidecar configuration

Since the Kafka TLS sidecar has been removed, the related configuration options in the Kafka custom resource are now deprecated:
* `.spec.kafka.tlsSidecar`
* `.spec.kafka.template.tlsSidecar`

## 0.19.0

* Add support for authorization using Open Policy Agent
* Add support for scale subresource to make scaling of following resources easier:
  * KafkaConnect
  * KafkaConnectS2I
  * KafkaBridge
  * KafkaMirrorMaker
  * KafkaMirrorMaker2
  * KafkaConnector 
* Remove deprecated `Kafka.spec.topicOperator` classes and deployment logic
* Use Java 11 as the Java runtime
* Removed the need to manually create Cruise Control metrics topics if topic auto creation is disabled.
* Migration to Helm 3
* Refactored the format of the `KafkaRebalance` resource's status. The state of the rebalance is now displayed in the associated `Condition`'s `type` field rather than the `status` field. This was done so that the information would display correctly in various Kubernetes tools.
* Added performance tuning options to the `KafkaRebalance` CR and the ability to define a regular expression that will exclude matching topics from a rebalance optimization proposal.
* Use Strimzi Kafka Bridge 0.18.0
* Make it possible to configure labels and annotations for secrets created by the User Operator
* Strimzi Kafka Bridge metrics integration:
  * enable/disable metrics in the KafkaBridge custom resource
  * new Grafana dashboard for the bridge metrics
* Support dynamically changeable logging in the Entity Operator and Kafka Bridge 
* Extended the Grafana example dashboard for Kafka Connect to provide more relevant information

### Deprecations and removals

#### Deprecation of Helm v2 chart

The Helm v2 support will end soon. 
Bug fixing should stop on August 13th 2020 and security fixes on November 13th.
See https://helm.sh/blog/covid-19-extending-helm-v2-bug-fixes/ for more details.

In sync with that, the Helm v2 chart of Strimzi Cluster Operator is now deprecated and will be removed in the future as Helm v2 support ends.
Since Strimzi 0.19.0, we have a new chart for Helm v3 which can be used instead.

#### Removal of v1alpha1 versions of several custom resources

In Strimzi 0.12.0, the `v1alpha1` versions of the following resources have been deprecated and replaced by `v1beta1`:
* `Kafka`
* `KafkaConnect`
* `KafkaConnectS2I`
* `KafkaMirrorMaker`
* `KafkaTopic`
* `KafkaUser`

In the next release, the `v1alpha1` versions of these resources will be removed. 
Please follow the guide for upgrading the resources: https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/full/deploying.html#assembly-upgrade-resources-str.

#### Removal deprecated cadvisor metric labels

The `pod_name` and `container_name` labels provided on the cadvisor metrics are now just `pod` and `container` starting from Kubernetes 1.16.
We removed the old ones from the Prometheus scraping configuration/alerts and on the Kafka and ZooKeeper dashboard as well.
It means that the charts related to memory and CPU usage are not going to work on Kuvbernetes version previous 1.14.
For more information on what is changed: https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3312

#### Deprecation of monitoring port on Kafka and ZooKeeper related services

The `PodMonitor` resource is now used instead of the `ServiceMonitor` for scraping metrics from Kafka, ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect and so on.
For this reason, we are deprecating the monitoring port `tcp-prometheus` (9404) on all the services where it is declared (Kafka bootstrap, ZooKeeper client and so on).
This port will be removed in the next release.
Together with it we will also remove the Prometheus annotation from the service.

#### Removal warning of Cluster Operator log level

Because of the new Cluster Operator dynamic logging configuration via [PR#3328](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/pull/3328) we are going to remove the `STRIMZI_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable from the Cluster Operator deployment YAML file in the 0.20.0 release.
