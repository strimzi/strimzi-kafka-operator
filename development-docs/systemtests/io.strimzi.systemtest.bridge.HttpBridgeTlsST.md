## testReceiveSimpleMessageTls

**Description:** Test to verify that a simple message can be received using TLS in a parallel environment.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Initialize the test storage instance. | TestStorage object is instantiated with the test context. |
| 2. | Configure Kafka Bridge client for consumption. | Kafka Bridge client is configured with topic and consumer names. |
| 3. | Create Kafka topic with provided configurations. | Kafka topic resource is created and available. |
| 4. | Deploy the Kafka Bridge consumer. | Kafka Bridge consumer starts successfully and is ready to consume messages. |
| 5. | Initialize TLS Kafka client for message production. | TLS Kafka client is configured and initialized. |
| 6. | Deploy the Kafka producer TLS client. | TLS Kafka producer client starts successfully and begins sending messages. |
| 7. | Verify message consumption. | Messages are successfully consumed by the Kafka Bridge consumer. |
