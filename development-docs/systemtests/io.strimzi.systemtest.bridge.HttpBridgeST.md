## testCustomAndUpdatedValues

**Description:** Test that validates the creation, update, and verification of a Kafka Bridge with specific initial and updated configurations.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Create a Kafka Bridge resource with initial configuration. | Kafka Bridge is created and deployed with the specified initial configuration. |
| 2. | Remove an environment variable that is in use. | Environment variable TEST_ENV_1 is removed from the initial configuration. |
| 3. | Verify initial probe values and environment variables. | The probe values and environment variables match the initial configuration. |
| 4. | Update Kafka Bridge resource with new configuration. | Kafka Bridge is updated and redeployed with the new configuration. |

## testCustomBridgeLabelsAreProperlySet

**Description:** Test verifying if custom labels and annotations for Kafka Bridge services are properly set and validated.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Initialize TestStorage | TestStorage instance is created with the current test context |
| 2. | Create Kafka Bridge resource with custom labels and annotations | Kafka Bridge resource is successfully created and available |
| 3. | Retrieve Kafka Bridge service with custom labels | Kafka Bridge service is retrieved with specified custom labels |
| 4. | Filter and validate custom labels and annotations | Custom labels and annotations match the expected values |

**Labels:**

* `label` (description file doesn't exist)
* `annotation` (description file doesn't exist)


## testDiscoveryAnnotation

**Description:** Test verifying the presence and correctness of the discovery annotation in the Kafka Bridge service.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Retrieve the Kafka Bridge service using kubeClient. | Kafka Bridge service instance is obtained. |
| 2. | Extract the discovery annotation from the service metadata. | The discovery annotation is retrieved as a string. |
| 3. | Convert the discovery annotation to a JsonArray. | JsonArray representation of the discovery annotation is created. |
| 4. | Validate the content of the JsonArray against expected values. | The JsonArray matches the expected service discovery information. |

**Labels:**

* `service_discovery_verification` (description file doesn't exist)
* `annotation_validation` (description file doesn't exist)

## testScaleBridgeToZero

**Description:** Test that scales a KafkaBridge instance to zero replicas and verifies that it is properly handled.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Create a KafkaBridge resource and wait for it to be ready. | KafkaBridge resource is created and ready with 1 replica. |
| 2. | Fetch the current number of KafkaBridge pods. | There should be exactly 1 KafkaBridge pod initially. |
| 3. | Scale KafkaBridge to zero replicas. | Scaling action is acknowledged. |
| 4. | Wait for KafkaBridge to scale down to zero replicas. | KafkaBridge scales down to zero replicas correctly. |
| 5. | Check the number of KafkaBridge pods after scaling | No KafkaBridge pods should be running |
| 6. | Verify the status of KafkaBridge | KafkaBridge status should indicate it is ready with zero replicas |
