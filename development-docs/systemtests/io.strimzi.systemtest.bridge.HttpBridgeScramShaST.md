## testReceiveSimpleMessageTlsScramSha

**Description:** Test to check the reception of a simple message via Kafka Bridge using TLS and SCRAM-SHA encryption.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Initialize TestStorage and BridgeClientsBuilder instances. | Instances are successfully initialized. |
| 2. | Create Kafka topic using ResourceManager. | Kafka topic is created and available. |

## testSendSimpleMessageTlsScramSha

**Description:** Test ensuring that sending a simple message using TLS and SCRAM-SHA authentication via Kafka Bridge works as expected.

**Steps:**

| Step | Action | Result |
| - | - | - |
| 1. | Create TestStorage and BridgeClients objects. | Instances of TestStorage and BridgeClients are created. |
| 2. | Create topic using the resource manager. | Topic is created successfully with the specified configuration. |
| 3. | Start producing messages via Kafka Bridge. | Messages are produced successfully to the topic. |
| 4. | Wait for producer success. | Producer finishes sending messages without errors. |
| 5. | Create KafkaClients and configure with TLS and SCRAM-SHA. | Kafka client is configured with appropriate security settings. |
| 6. | Start consuming messages via Kafka client. | Messages are consumed successfully from the topic. |
| 7. | Wait for consumer success. | Consumer finishes receiving messages without errors. |
