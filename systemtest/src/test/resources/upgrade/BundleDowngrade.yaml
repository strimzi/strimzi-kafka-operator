#  fromVersion: String - From this version we will start downgrade of the CO

#  toExamples: String - Folder name which contains examples to upgrade / downgrade to. Downloaded from "toUrl"
#  fromUrl: String - url, from which examples are downloaded
#  toUrl: String - url, from which examples are downloaded during downgrade and replace the original ones
#  fromKafkaVersionsUrl: String - url, from which kafka-versions.yaml is downloaded
#  additionalTopics: int - number of additional topics, which will be created
#  imagesAfterOperations:  Strings - images that corresponding pods should contain. They are checked after downgrade

#    userOperator: 
#  deployKafkaVersion: String - version of Kafka, used in initial deployment of Kafka cluster.
#                               It has to be the oldest supported version of Kafka in newer version of Strimzi (the one we are downgrading from).
#                               This version specified in `deployKafkaVersion` has to be in a list of supported version of the Strimzi version we are downgrading to.
#                               That's because we are waiting for successful downgrade of CO with rolling update of all components.
#                               Having unsupported Kafka version specified would fail the test, as the cluster would be in the `NotReady` state (and there wouldn't be any rolling update).
#                               In case that you want to use Kafka version unsupported in the older version of Strimzi, you will have to handle it in the test code directly.

#    continuousClientsMessages: int - message count sent during upgrade
#  environmentInfo:
#    maxK8sVersion: String - maximal version of Kubernetes on which the upgrade test runs
#    status: stable  String - info about stability of the testing environment
#    flakyEnvVariable: String - name of the environmental variable which is flaky on current environment
#    reason: String - reason why we skip / not skip the test case (information, not propagated to test itself)
