#  deployKafkaVersion: String - version of Kafka, used in initial deployment of Kafka cluster.
#                               It has to be the oldest supported version of Kafka in newer version of Strimzi (the one we are downgrading from).
#                               This version specified in `deployKafkaVersion` has to be in a list of supported version of the Strimzi version we are downgrading to.
#                               That's because we are waiting for successful downgrade of CO with rolling update of all components.
#                               Having unsupported Kafka version specified would fail the test, as the cluster would be in the `NotReady` state (and there wouldn't be any rolling update).
#                               In case that you want to use Kafka version unsupported in the older version of Strimzi, you will have to handle it in the test code directly.

#  environmentInfo:
#    maxK8sVersion: String - maximal version of Kubernetes on which the upgrade test runs

#    flakyEnvVariable: String - name of the environmental variable which is flaky on current environment
