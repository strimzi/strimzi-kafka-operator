#  --- Prerequisites ---
#  The Operator Hub contains only the already released versions of Strimzi Cluster Operator - those that are available
#  at https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases/ .
#  For running OLM upgrade tests, you need to build a custom catalog with images from the main branch and load it in your
#  Kubernetes cluster.
