                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace

                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              after the eviction. Setting this value to 0 prevents
                              all voluntary evictions, so the pods must be evicted
                              manually. Defaults to 1.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.

                              signal, and the time when the processes are forcibly
                              halted with a kill signal. Set this value to longer
                              than the expected cleanup time for your process. Value
                              must be a non-negative integer. A zero value indicates
                              delete immediately. You might need to increase the grace
                              period for very large Kafka clusters, so that the Kafka
                              brokers have enough time to transfer their work to another
                              broker before they are terminated. Defaults to 30 seconds.
