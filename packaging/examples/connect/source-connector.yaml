# To use the KafkaConnector resource, you have to first enable the connector operator using
# the strimzi.io/use-connector-resources annotation on the KafkaConnect custom resource.
# From Apache Kafka 3.1.1 and 3.2.0, you also have to add the FileStreamSourceConnector
# connector to the container image. You can do that using the kafka-connect-build.yaml example.
