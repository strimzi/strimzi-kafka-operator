## Container signatures

From the 0.38.0 release, Strimzi containers are signed using the [`cosign` tool](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
Strimzi currently does not use the keyless signing and the transparency log.
To verify the container, you can copy the following public key into a file:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAET3OleLR7h0JqatY2KkECXhA9ZAkC
TRnbE23Wb5AzJPnpevvQ1QUEQQ5h/I4GobB7/jkGfqYkt6Ct5WOU2cc6HQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

And use it to verify the signature:

```
cosign verify --key strimzi.pub quay.io/strimzi/operator:latest --insecure-ignore-tlog=true
```

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

From the 0.38.0 release, Strimzi publishes the software bill of materials (SBOM) of our containers.
The SBOMs are published as an archive with `SPDX-JSON` and `Syft-Table` formats signed using cosign.
For releases, they are also pushed into the container registry.
To verify the SBOM signatures, please use the Strimzi public key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAET3OleLR7h0JqatY2KkECXhA9ZAkC
TRnbE23Wb5AzJPnpevvQ1QUEQQ5h/I4GobB7/jkGfqYkt6Ct5WOU2cc6HQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

You can use it to verify the signature of the SBOM files with the following command:

```
cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --bundle <SBOM-file>.bundle --insecure-ignore-tlog=true <SBOM-file>
```
